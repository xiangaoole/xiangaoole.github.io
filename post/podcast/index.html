      <p>Podcast is an audio program format similar to ancient radio stations. It costs less to produce than video content and more than text content. Listening to podcasts is much easier than reading text, and it is easier to gain more in-depth and detailed insights by listening to podcasts than watching videos.</p>
<p>For me, the most attractive thing about listening to podcasts is the companionship and nourishment. It’s like sitting among a group of people and listening to them chatting. You can feel everyone’s voice and smile through the sound, and feel the atmosphere of the conversation at that time. What’s more, The important thing is that you can discover a lot of interesting people and open up a lot of interesting worlds through a favorite podcast.</p>
<p>Starting from listening to Ms. F’s monthly updated radio program on NetEase Cloud Music in 2015, to listening to “Be Fortunate” on Himalaya, and then to listening to a lot of podcasts using the dedicated podcast application “Little Universe” in 2019, my history of listening to podcasts It&rsquo;s been over 8 years. Podcasts have had a lot of influence on me. &ldquo;Speaking of the Evening Breeze&rdquo; prompted me to travel to Dali for 2 months after leaving my job in 2020. Digital nomad-related podcasts prompted me to quit my job and start taking a gap year in 2023.</p>
<p>Here I would like to share with you some podcast programs that I have heard very much, maybe you can also find your favorite program among them. (Unless otherwise specified, all podcasts can be listened to in the &ldquo;Little Universe&rdquo; APP.)</p>
<p>[TOC]</p>
<h2 id="miss-fs-radio-series">Miss F&rsquo;s radio series</h2>
<p>Miss F’s radio station belongs to the humanities and social sciences category. She majors in journalism and communication, and her mother is a professional radio host. Therefore, her podcast performs well in terms of soundtrack, sound quality, editing and pronunciation. It is recommended to listen to NetEase Cloud Music, because in addition to the programs exclusively broadcast by NetEase Cloud Music, you can also see the anchor&rsquo;s messages and listener comments from many years ago. As Miss F said, &ldquo;Use your own voice to interpret your own words.&rdquo; Her podcast is written first and then interpreted, and each issue has a complete text version.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot; <a href="https://music.163.com/#/radio?id=428009">Mortal Corner</a> &ldquo;: It has a history of eight years, from the early monthly update to the current annual update.

</ul>
<h2 id="evening-breeze-says-by-jade">&ldquo;Evening Breeze Says&rdquo; by Jade</h2>
<p>The podcast that has had the most profound impact on me contains a large number of interviews with people who have lived in Dali, and historical records of the life journeys of many ordinary and interesting people. The podcast content has been deleted by the host from all platforms and cannot be listened to in Xiaouniverse.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot; <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e104-94067266">E104 Ba Ya Ya | Please enjoy your ice and snow alone</a> .&rdquo; Ba Yamo&rsquo;s collection of poems is one of the few that I can read in its entirety. As the cover of her collection says, &ldquo;People say that gentle people have wisdom. I don&rsquo;t want wisdom, just gentleness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&quot; <a href="http://163cn.tv/QA2HN1">E89 Huanzi | Before the advent of artificial wombs, equality between men and women was impossible.</a> &quot; This sensitive topic was discussed in more depth along with a news incident involving a certain female star at the time.

<li>&quot; <a href="http://163cn.tv/0ZSak0">E70 Jade &amp; Doudou (Fu Lu Shou)</a> &ldquo;. The opening song made me want to stop playing. From this podcast, I got to know a psychedelic band Fu Lu Shou that I really like and a sci-fi drama &ldquo;Loop Story&rdquo; that I really like. Later, I met a good friend in Dali who also liked this band.</li>
<li>&quot; <a href="http://163cn.tv/el2ID3">E50 Jade &amp; Li Jianzhang</a> &ldquo;. Lao Li is a Dali pottery maker. This is the first time I have met such a sincere person. &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; always comes first among &ldquo;truth, goodness and beauty&rdquo;. &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; means being cold and not kidnapped by morality and filial piety.</li>
<li>Jade&rsquo;s other great podcasts are guest appearances with other podcasts. For everyone&rsquo;s convenience, they are placed in the chapters of &ldquo;Getting carried away&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tavern&rdquo;, and &ldquo;God loves to play with money&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="zhang-xiaoyus-getting-carried-away">Zhang Xiaoyu’s “getting carried away”</h2>
<p>Zhang Xiaoyu is an investor with a background in finance. She can chat with the spiritual blogger Xue Ba Mao, have a drink with the math enthusiast Bro Feng, talk about psychology with the psychological counselor Jian Lili, and also chat with the psychological counselor Jian Lili. Jade, who has the same financial background, talked about Bitcoin and meditation together, and also created the first investment lesson of &ldquo;knowing and doing&rdquo; with entrepreneur Meng Yan. At the same time, he wants to create a decentralized education form to popularize basic logical knowledge to the public.</p>

How to let yourself go and find peace of mind. When I heard the ending song, I happened to be walking on the mountain. The green trees in the distance were layered in the mountain space, and white clouds were embedded in the deep blue sky. It was already evening, and Sakamoto Ryuichi&rsquo;s music rose. , that moment was super wonderful. When you are ready, the universe will respond to you. When the student is ready, the teacher appears.</li>

<h2 id="knowledge-and-action-bistro">&ldquo;Knowledge and Action Bistro&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A very important financial knowledge popularization podcast, produced by a financial management team with a good reputation. If you don’t know how to manage your savings and are confused about whether you should buy a house, stocks or funds, whether you should withdraw your provident fund in cash, or whether you should buy commercial medical insurance, you might as well come to a tavern and have a seat.</p>
<ul>
<li>“ <a href="https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/63f82a12a42b41bccb657cfa">E76 I really wish! I knew these real estate common sense before buying a house</a> .” Are your parents urging you to buy a house? Let them listen to this one.</li>

The public account &quot; <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7Kx0FxMdVE1-RPhVqJtl8w">Money Talk</a> &quot; has changed a lot of my views on financial freedom. FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) may not be a path worth taking. The financial concepts of &ldquo;Also Talking About Money&rdquo; are not only very high-quality on the domestic Internet, but after I started listening to English podcasts, I found that his summary of investment books is even better than what the English author of the original book himself said in the podcast.</li>

<li>An onion: &quot; <a href="https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/634f69fae67030aadb38f9f8">Knowledge can be shared, but wisdom cannot</a> .&rdquo; Hesse&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo; tells the story of Siddhartha, a young Brahmin nobleman who practiced Buddhism and became a Buddha. This issue&rsquo;s interpretation of the book is very spiritual.</li>
<li>Air bed and breakfast: &quot; <a href="https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/61c1e0cbc70a00f60aeb4f87">EP3 Yangshuo not only has mountains and rivers and rice noodles, but also outdoor sports and good landlords</a> .&rdquo; Before <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Wo8IsHneaDvK_pKF9CMsmw">traveling to Yangshuo</a> , I listened to this podcast on Airbnb and found a good host.</li>
<li>Fanning the flames: &quot; <a href="https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/609b0f8f9ff6e8a89fceb775">It is safest to give up a safe life</a> .&quot; This podcast episode by digital nomad Alison Wang has some inspiration for breaking the established life framework, and the top comments are also very interesting. Sometimes, it is better to change yourself than to change the environment. If you need to escape, you have to escape.</li>

<h2 id="ps-english-podcast">PS English Podcast</h2>
<p>Listening to English podcasts is very effective in improving your English ability. One suggestion is to find a program that interests you the most. It is interesting enough that you can keep listening to it. As long as you keep listening, you will soon notice the effect. Another suggestion is to focus on understanding the entire context rather than listening to every sentence. You may only understand 30% of the content at first, but you can gradually improve to 80%. After listening to many daily English interviews, your reading speed of English books will naturally increase.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot; <a href="https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/614b5100f0adde227e45676a">Yeah, Why Not Podcast</a> &ldquo;: A podcast about the life of Chinese international students. The spoken English is very fluent and standard, and there are not too many new words. It is very suitable as an introduction to English podcasts.</li>
<li>&ldquo;THD Chinese-American English Interview Show&rdquo;: Three Chinese-Americans interview Chinese-Americans from all walks of life working in Shanghai. They have more new words, speak faster, and the topics are local and interesting. For example, &quot; <a href="https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/643f89019361a4e7c3effb15">120 Larry Wang: The Right Direction</a> &quot; talks about how to find career direction in confusion.</li>
<li><a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/SC5EFDD8C">“Waking Up” APP</a> : Sam Harris is a neuroscientist who studies meditation from an atheist perspective. Although Sam Harris also has a podcast, I recommend his meditation app more. The introductory meditation class in the APP is great and easy to stick to. It only takes 20 minutes a day, 10 minutes of meditation practice, and 10 minutes of theoretical knowledge behind meditation. The entire APP also has many podcast conversations and meditation courses between Sam and other scientists and practitioners, which are organized very clearly. The English of the introductory meditation course is not very difficult, but some interviews are very fast and contain many new words, but after extensive listening for a long time, you will naturally understand most of the meaning.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Indie Hacker&rdquo;: An interview show for independent developers, where you can hear the opinions of many famous developers. For example, &quot; <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/043-pieter-levels-of-nomad-list">E04 Confronting Your Fears and Taking a Leap</a> &quot; by Pieter, the developer of Nomad List. (Can&rsquo;t find it in Little Universe, you need to go to the official website to listen)</li>
<li>&quot; <a href="https://www.fluent.show/">The Fluent Show</a> &ldquo;: Regarding the experience and methods of foreign language learning, the British accent is very nice. (Can&rsquo;t find it in Little Universe, you need to go to the official website to listen)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Healthy Hacker&rdquo;: A Ruby programmer&rsquo;s personal podcast, which has been discontinued for 4 years. He switched careers to make music. A very interesting programmer shared how to quickly remember the names of strangers and how to share them at a developer conference. &quot; <a href="https://www.healthyhacker.com/2014/10/06/growing-as-a-programmer/">11 Growing as a programmer</a> &quot; tells the story of his career from working in the Apple Genius Bar to becoming a Github employee. (Can&rsquo;t find it in Little Universe, you need to go to the official website to listen)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are limited English podcasts on &ldquo;Little Universe&rdquo;, and the new version has removed the function of adding podcasts through RSS, and some podcasts cannot be added. So if you want to listen to more English podcasts, you can choose other apps, such as Overcast (recommended for iOS) and Pocket Casts (recommended for Android).</p>
