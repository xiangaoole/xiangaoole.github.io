<meta name="author" content="Harold Gao" /><meta name="description" content="Podcast is an audio program format similar to ancient radio stations. It costs less to produce than video content and more than text content. Listening to podcasts is much easier than reading text, and it is easier to gain more in-depth and detailed insights by listening to podcasts than watching videos.
For me, the most attractive thing about listening to podcasts is the companionship and nourishment. It’s like sitting among a group of people and listening to them chatting. You can feel everyone’s voice and smile through the sound, and feel the atmosphere of the conversation at that time. What’s more, The important thing is that you can discover a lot of interesting people and open up a lot of interesting worlds through a favorite podcast.
Starting from listening to Ms. F’s monthly updated radio program on NetEase Cloud Music in 2015, to listening to “Be Fortunate” on Himalaya, and then to listening to a lot of podcasts using the dedicated podcast application “Little Universe” in 2019, my history of listening to podcasts It&amp;rsquo;s been over 8 years. Podcasts have had a lot of influence on me. &amp;ldquo;Speaking of the Evening Breeze&amp;rdquo; prompted me to travel to Dali for 2 months after leaving my job in 2020. Digital nomad-related podcasts prompted me to quit my job and start a gap year travel in 2023.
Here I would like to share with you some podcast programs that I have heard very much, maybe you can also find your favorite program among them. (Unless otherwise specified, all podcasts can be listened to in the &amp;ldquo;Little Universe&amp;rdquo; APP.)

<p>Miss F’s radio station belongs to the humanities and social sciences category. She majors in journalism and communication, and her mother is a professional radio host. Therefore, her podcast performs well in terms of soundtrack, sound quality, editing and pronunciation. It is recommended to listen to NetEase Cloud Music, because in addition to the programs exclusively broadcast by NetEase Cloud Music, you can also see the anchor&rsquo;s messages and listener comments from many years ago. As Miss F said, &ldquo;Use your own voice to interpret your own words.&rdquo; Her podcast is written first and then interpreted, and each issue has a complete text version.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://music.163.com/#/radio?id=428009">Mortal Corner</a>&rdquo;: It has a history of eight years, from the early monthly update to the current yearly update. Rich in emotion and full of ideal and romantic temperament, it often moves people to tears. &ldquo;<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7bQrAflWMEGhLheXFdWRgg">001 A small room to hold all of myself</a>&rdquo;, the first episode of the podcast, the story begins here; &ldquo;<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uwWYmuiB8qSkmaSe2l5fuA">016 Not just a love story That’s all</a>” You can hear how a professional anchor uses multiple voices to interpret an interesting and touching situational love story; Older Me](<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gdbR4Zf_eiTMX2rwqPuMjA">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gdbR4Zf_eiTMX2rwqPuMjA</a>)” allows you to hear the voice of your inner child; “[100 Stories of Books and Fire](https://mp .weixin.qq.com/s/A7o-6hJHrzpp_V-yWsIT2A)&rdquo; was released in Guangzhou at the end of 2022.

<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://music.163.com/#/djradio?id=986329877">Mortal Love</a>&rdquo;: Exclusively played by NetEase Cloud Music, each issue talks about different aspects of love from a movie. &ldquo;<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QxD_e2X9OP67KDYrDTfc-A">Vol. 5 Humans Fall in Love with AI</a>&rdquo; is about the science fiction movie Hers, a love story between humans and artificial intelligence. In this matter, perhaps artificial intelligence can see more clearly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evening-breeze-says-by-jade">&ldquo;Evening Breeze Says&rdquo; by Jade</h2>
<p>The podcast that has had the most profound impact on me contains a large number of interviews with people who have lived in Dali, and historical records of the life journeys of many ordinary and interesting people. The podcast content has been deleted by the host from all platforms and cannot be listened to in Xiaouniverse.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e104-94067266">E104 Ba Ya Ya | Please enjoy your ice and snow alone</a>&rdquo;. Ba Yamo&rsquo;s collection of poems is one of the few that I can read in its entirety. As the cover of her collection says, &ldquo;People say that gentle people have wisdom. I don&rsquo;t want wisdom, just gentleness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="http://163cn.tv/QA2HN1">E89 Huanzi | Before the emergence of artificial wombs, equality between men and women was impossible</a>&rdquo;, accompanying the news incident of a certain female star at that time, discussed this sensitive issue in more depth topic. Some topics are better avoided than faced.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="http://163cn.tv/0ZSak0">E70 Jade &amp; Doudou (Fu Lu Shou)</a>&rdquo;. The opening song made me want to stop playing. From this podcast, I got to know a psychedelic band Fu Lu Shou that I really like and a sci-fi drama &ldquo;Loop Story&rdquo; that I really like. Later, I met a good friend in Dali who also liked this band.</li>

This is the first time I have met such a sincere person. &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; always comes first among &ldquo;truth, goodness and beauty&rdquo;. &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; means being cold and not kidnapped by morality and filial piety.</li>
<li>Jade&rsquo;s other great podcasts are guest appearances with other podcasts. For everyone&rsquo;s convenience, they are placed in the chapters of &ldquo;Getting carried away&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tavern&rdquo;, and &ldquo;God loves to play with money&rdquo;.</li>
