      <p>At [HTTPS://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cxdsqgbl7qn1MTFAZOJHBG), I watched Li An&rsquo;s &ldquo;Happy Banquet&rdquo; (released in 1993). This is the second time I look at it. When I look at it, I just feel good -looking, interesting, rich. After reading it, I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, but in the later Yu Yun, some personal feelings were raised.</p>
<h2 id="1-sexual-depression">1. Sexual depression</h2>
<p>The first is about sexual descriptions. In the film, the heroine always does not wear bras when painting, and let the thin shirt stick to the chest. This is a true and bold description. In the current film and television works of the mainland, those characters that deliberately expose the cleavage are far less natural. In the back of the film, there is a shot of naked upper upper body when the heroine takes a bath. This lens is unnecessary to promote the plot, but I think it is interacting with the audience, let the audience really participate, and experience &ldquo;five thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand The influence of years of depression on us. When I see this shot, I will suddenly play, and I will observe whether others are seeing me at concentrating on this lens, and I will feel a little bit as embarrassing to express my interest in sex.</p>
<p>The director only made a shot in the film, and only said one sentence, that is, when the crowd was fried at the wedding banquet, he said to foreign guests, &ldquo;You are seeing the result of 5,000 years of depression.&rdquo; In fact, I did n’t understand at first, why did I add the customs of the wedding and “sex depression” and the cause and effect.</p>
<p>The Chinese are the image of &ldquo;softness and silence and mathematics genius&rdquo; in the eyes of foreigners, but when they arrive at the wedding banquet, they have a lively energy of doing things. The father in the film is the image of a traditional Chinese elder. He likes calligraphy. When he is sitting in the chief, the landlord will have to wash the dishes by himself and give a look at the juniors. But at the wedding banquet, he was very happy when everyone was engaged in all kinds of sexual hints, because the more lively the wedding was, he would be more face. The various signs of the movie also implied that his father was likely to be homosexual, but he was hidden well as a master of the army, as a master of a family, and a traditional Chinese.</p>
<h2 id="2-perfect-ending">2. Perfect ending</h2>
<p>The end of the film seems to have reached a perfect ending. The same -sex lover has not separated. The heroine gets American green cards and life security. Old parents see their son become a family. But think carefully, how fragile this is perfect. At the beginning of the whole story, the old parents hope that the son can continue the incense of the Gao family, urge his son to get married, and want to hug his grandson early; the old father saw the first sentence of the female lead as &ldquo;can be born and can raise&rdquo;; The Lord&rsquo;s message is, &ldquo;Gao family will thank you.&rdquo; From the perspective of the parents, the mission of traditional culture to them is to continue the family incense. The female lead seems to be a completeness that meets their purpose, but if the girl is born, the expectation of this continuation of the incense is right. It was broken.</p>
<p>As long as the old tradition of continuing the incense (male male) is not eliminated, and not with this tradition, the son in the film will not have a perfect ending.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-present-past-and-future">3. The present, past, and future</h2>
<p>The times are developing. Thirty years ago in the mainland, there may be many Chinese people who were trapped by this old tradition, but in 2021, we clearly have different awareness of LGBT people and girls.</p>
<p>The director made such a film, and I think it was also recording the Chinese society he observed at the time. One hundred years later, when people see this film, they may be surprised that our culture used to have such a part of this, and it lasted for thousands of years. It may be like we see ancient women&rsquo;s feet now, it is a bad habit that stopped 100 years ago.</p>
<br/>
<p>Of course, we hope that our culture can develop in a better direction, so we have to think about, why can we find and change some bad habits now? Why did we lose their feet 100 years ago, and why do we accept LGBT today?</p>
<p>The background of &ldquo;Happy Banquet&rdquo; is that Chinese live in the United States. The cultural differences between the younger generations and the older generation of Taiwanese people who live in the United States for a long time have been built. Calling and affecting our footsteps is the return of overseas to study abroad and Chinese people who have accepted new ideas in China. Let us accept LGBT more, I think it is from the frequent attention of mainstream overseas film and television dramas.</p>
<p>Constantly exposure to new and different things can increase our awareness of existing things. We need to embrace a variety of opposition, embrace changes against stubbornness, and allow our culture to develop in a better direction.</p>
<p>This is better, which is beyond the times and politics, with the general value of human beings. The universal value of human beings has always existed. For example, in the Dream of Red Mansions, the Qing Dynasty people&rsquo;s attention to the enlightenment of sexual enlightenment, female, and gay men in the Qing Dynasty. These universal values are not only available now, but they are suppressed in the mainstream discourse for a while. Perhaps as the director spoke personally, &ldquo;you are seeing the result of five thousand years of depression.&rdquo;</p>
