      <p>The earliest wanted to go to Yangshuo was to see a Chinese article &ldquo;Lonely Planet&rdquo; in the Youth Hostel of Shaxi Ancient Town.</p>
<p>During the May Day holiday in 2022, I finally went to Yangshuo. Many of the schedules were temporarily arranged, but the people and the people and actually made a wonderful holiday life beyond their expectations.</p>
<p>The experience of each day is great, so the first half is directly shared this wonderful journey with daily records. The second half will summarize some small experiences for readers who want to travel to Yangshuo and hope to help you.</p>
<h3 id="day-1-betty-家晚餐"><strong>Day 1 Betty 家晚餐</strong></h3>
<p>Out of the Yangshuo High -speed Railway Station, there were still light rain, which was a bit cold in spring. Friends from Guangdong opened the suitcase and took out their jackets and put them on. Take the high -speed rail station bus (） 20) and reach Yangshuo Fengming Tourism Distribution Center for more than an hour. Get off your luggage and get out of the car and take another 20 minutes to reach the old county and villages.</p>
<p>Get off the bus, surrounded by the green mountains, the ducks in the farmland are playing, the big goose growls, the peasants are talking far away, drizzle, moisturizing the air.</p>
<p>With a few steps to drag the suitcase, Betty&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old House&rdquo; homestay is hidden in this ancient residence of the countryside without any disagreement. The &ldquo;old house&rdquo; house is like grandma&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s house in memory, old wooden doors, tall tile tops, brick walls, a bit humid and cold. Betty poured me a cup of flower tea, and we sat down in the house.</p>
<p>There are two friends in Betty in the evening, and we have dinner together. Dinner is divided into meals, a plate of main dishes, a bowl of fresh shrimp pumpkin stewed chicken soup.</p>
<p>After dinner, I played the &ldquo;speed and passion&rdquo; of the poker card, drinking the self -brewed green plum wine, and when I talked about late at night, I went back to bed first, and Betty had to wait for the next stay in the next night.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-baisha-ganji--crayfish-party">Day 2 Baisha Ganji &amp; crayfish party</h3>
<p>The rushing day of Baisha Town is 1/4/7 at the end of each month. This day is 5.1, and I just caught up. In fact, the rush of the villagers nearby brings their own agricultural products to the market to buy and sell on the market. Because they usually live far, they can only gather together to form a lively market.</p>
<p>Brown sugar is very delicious, fragrant and delicious, a bit like the taste of fried pumpkin cakes. Camellia is Gongcheng&rsquo;s specialty. Ginger, spices and tea are boiled together, filter off the residue, put it in the opening of the kettle. When the guest comes, grab a small fried ball into the bowl, then pour the camellia from the kettle, scoop A little salt, it is fragrant, hot and bitter, but the aftertaste is rich and sweet.</p>
<p>Betty bought pumpkin seedlings in the market and went back to the backyard to take off. In order to prevent the nearby chicken from damaging, a simple cover was set up around the melon seedlings.</p>
<p>There are two entrances in the backyard, and the first is a green brick flat ground that can be grilled, with a hammock. Passing through a small door, walking on the mountain a few steps is the second entrance, surrounding a small vegetable field with stones, planting peppers, pumpkin &hellip; The second enters are a row of bamboo, and there are several bamboo shoots on the ground.</p>
<p>I eat crayfish at dinner, and go to my friend Ding Ding&rsquo;s house to help handle crayfish in the afternoon. The Ding Ding family also opened a homestay, and the location was remote. At the foot of the mountain, the backyard passed on to the mountain.</p>
<p>It rained in the afternoon. I took an umbrella and walked along the mountain. I saw a lot of special homestays all the way, including the &ldquo;Rose Garden&rdquo; homestay mentioned in the Guilin chapter of &ldquo;Lonely Planet&rdquo;. Go to the vegetable field and enter a staircase paved along the small road. It was surprising that Xiaoyu hit the rustling on the umbrella, and the birds screamed in the forest. Along the stone steps, the trees on both sides are dense, and the branches pass through the waterproof jacket, but I still wet my pants. This mountain road has been connected to the connection between the two mountains. It seems that there is a road forward. I decided to visit the next time.</p>
<p>Walking in the fields in a direction, surrounded by Karst landform specialty mountains, the chickens and dogs of the farmhouse, the sound of flowing water, and the thin rain silk, here is like a paradise.</p>
<p>The expectations of the expectation began. The aroma of crayfish was fragrant, with cold cucumbers, boiled peanut rice, and a delicious Liquan beer. After a table, people eat 2 big cookers, and get up to 2 large pots, and eat half of them. Cook with the noodles together. The noodles are soaked with fresh shrimp flavor, which is very delicious.</p>
<p>In the second half of dinner, Betty&rsquo;s husband, Devin, came back from the field and joined us, but he only ate vegetarian and eat the garlic fried celery and fried potatoes prepared for him. When the weather was cold, the Ding Ding family prepared a bonfire, and the guests gradually surrounded the bonfire. Devin played the guitar (he was the musician of the Demo bar), and Betty sang a song (professional singer), listening to it! Then the guitarist was replaced by Ding Ding&rsquo;s husband, and the guests began to sing. The bonfire was very strong, and it was warm.</p>
<h3 id="day-3-攀岩徒步">Day 3 攀岩&amp;徒步</h3>
<p>After eating a large bowl of pot of rice noodles in the morning, go to the Baiyan Rock Farm and try climbing. There is already a ready -made hanging point on the rock wall. The coaches climbed up along the hanging point, hung the fulcrum at the highest place, and hung the rope. The fulcrum is a sliding rail structure. One end of the rope is buckled on the climber&rsquo;s waist, and the other end is buckled on the protector&rsquo;s waist. As the climbers go up, the protector will close the rope to ensure that the climbers will not fall even if they lose their hands.</p>
<p>The tip of the rock climbing shoe step on the gap in the rock wall, focus on the legs, and support the waist upwards. But I was nervous, and my arms were sore quickly. Everyone is very powerful, especially girls are very smart. Unlike boys, girls will use more flexible postures. One girl climbed all 5 lines.</p>
<p>The weather was fine that day, and the little partner was about to prepare the mountain road discovered by the walk yesterday in the afternoon. There are many branches along the stone steps, but there are obvious people walking through this road. There are loquat trees on the side of the road. On the other side of the hillside, the stone steps are replaced by stone, surrounded by orange gardens, and the flavor of farm fat can be smelled in the air. Then the road is spacious, and the traces of farm tools appear. This is a large orchard, including oranges, oranges, mulberries, and then down the vegetable field. The little partner teaches me to identify what kind of species.</p>
<p>Soon entering the quiet village, a elder sister washed carrots in the pond, and gave us the two carrots that had just been taken off. Wash the soil with pond water, and clicked up. Along the road is the cement road of the countryside. This is Baishabao Village. Going along the cement road, there is another orange garden. After asking the villagers, we decided to turn over the mountain in front.</p>
<p>The villagers are spraying pesticides, and the air has a uncomfortable pesticide taste. We walked through the dense shrubbage, finally found the road down the mountain, returned to the village along the orchard, and returned to the stone steps.</p>
<p>Back to the &ldquo;Old House&rdquo; and communicated with Betty, we knew that we were walking here on a hiking route. It was really lucky.</p>
<h3 id="day-4-魔鬼洞">Day 4 魔鬼洞</h3>
<p>Some of the rock climbing experiencers yesterday morning participated in today&rsquo;s technical cave with me. Leader Jerry drove us to Xingping. There was also a Polish climbing Jianjian Oula. Her Chinese was very good to introduce the interesting knowledge of healthy vegetarian food and mushrooms.</p>
<p>Wearing a belt, wearing a helmet, and a detection light. After obtaining the permission of the owner of the cave, we went up the mountain to enter the cave. The caves of the scenic area are shined with colorful lights. In fact, the cave is white and gray. After oxidation, it will be gray and black. The clean column has milky white.</p>
<p>It ’s okay to climb up, and it’ s much better than the rock wall. It is always a bit embarrassed when you fall, and often hit the stone wall. The final exit is cool, just like the cave exit in the Xbox game halo series, but this climbing is very challenging to me. Finally, it is difficult to get in a difficult place. The rope went out. The exit is in the middle of the mountain, and it is also an orange garden. The sun is very good. The mountains are surrounded by the mountains. Someone is playing gliding umbrellas and hot air balloons in the distance.</p>
<p>The cave was stunned, and there was climbing. He was exhausted and fell asleep. The video of the cave Jerry was released to [Xiaohongshu] (<a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/627300000002103b47b?secondshare=weixin&amp;SER_FROM_HIDDEN=TRue)">https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/627300000002103b47b?secondshare=weixin&amp;SER_FROM_HIDDEN=TRue)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="day-5-摩托车溯溪">Day 5 摩托车&amp;溯溪</h3>
<p>After sleeping, physical strength recovered. In the morning, we gathered in the old house of Betty and set off to the valley of the stream. The distance is relatively long, Devin rides motorcycle Betty, I ride a motorcycle to carry another little partner. This is the first time I ride a motorcycle and the first manned, but it is easy to learn. Motorcycles are more stable than battery cars.</p>
<p>In the sunny weather, ride county roads, rural trails, and around the mountains, passing by a waterfall, gradually hearing the sound of spring water and seeing clear streams. Put on a sandals, step on the stream, cool and not ice, wading all the way to stepping on the stone, to a pond water. Betty frowned and said that someone had been here. It was destroyed here. There was a car print on the road. The logging camp was built ahead.</p>
<p>We stopped at the side of the pond, fry the raw fire rack, Betty frying the heart of poached eggs, sprinkled the existing black pepper and salt, sandwiched in a bread piece, bite it with a bite, and the egg yolk flowed out. It was very delicious.</p>
<p>Devin was healthy, cleaned up the camp, and pulled a suspender before stones and trees. After eating and drinking, I was lying on the hammock, looking at the woods and sky on the top of the mountain in the distance.</p>
<p>Packing the garbage and luggage, the original road returned, the sun gradually softened, the sun on the valley shown the intimate back of Betty and Devin. What a wonderful afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="day-6-全家州徒步">Day 6 全家州徒步</h3>
<p>按照《孤独星球》桂林篇的指点，我和小伙伴今天计划从兴坪一路徒步到全家州（14 公里）。</p>
<p>Take a passenger car from Yangshuo Bus Station to Xingping, walk along the Lijiang River from Xingping Ancient Town to the Cold Water Village Ferry, take a boat by 10 yuan to cross the river, cross the river is the Bama Painting Mountain, and then continue to walk along the rural highway to the Jiatianxia Scenic Area.</p>
<p>This part is not very good. The maximum temperature of the day reached 31 degrees, and there were fewer trees along the road. They were all flat and hot roads. But on the section of the world, it began to become a slate road along the river, with shade and cool breeze.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a thing that cleaned my soul happened here. There are scattered vendors in the Scenic Area of the A World, and some are older grandparents. According to my consistent habits, I ignore the vendors along the way and not talk to them. My little friend bought two small fish stones at an old grandma. The old grandmother did not have a QR code, but fortunately I brought cash, and my grandmother hesitated to find my 50 yuan banknotes into change, from her volume of change. I found a brand new banknote and replaced me, and the pocket reminded me of my grandmother. I didn&rsquo;t respond yet.</p>
<p>Below we met a grandfather again. The friends were there to pick the slingshot there. The grandfather&rsquo;s ears were not listened to our bargaining, but we were more than ten yuan, and then picked up small stones on the ground. far away. Suddenly I was moved. The two shops bought by my friends were the crafts stalls of grandparents and grandma, and I just bought a bag of oranges for thirst. Looking at the grandfather&rsquo;s demonstration, I turned my back and my eyes were wet.</p>
<p>When I came back in bed at night, I remembered the grandmother and grandpa I met today. Imagine a long afternoon. They stayed in front of the stall and stayed in the empty old house. Why, I just hope that I can be a kind person in the future.</p>
<p>Along the slate road, there are no other tourists, there are only us on the road, there are many leaves. The roadside is constantly seeing the warning sign of the &ldquo;collapse section, passing cautious&rdquo;, and also the advertisement of &ldquo;the family weekly hiking section, please call XXX&rdquo;. The experience of this way is very good, passing through the whole family state villages and arriving at the home of the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely Planet&rdquo; said that the ferry ship on the other side had been stopped, so we trimmed it at the ferry and washed our feet. I did not intend to see the crossing the river on the crossbar of the ferry. After the call, someone came to drive us to cross the river, 10 yuan per person.</p>
<p>After crossing the river, it is the orchard. It is not in the direction of Xingping. When the river was resting at the fruit farmers, their large oranges had been picked up and were acquired. They left the fruit and they were preparing to throw away. When we met us, we gave us a large bag of fresh and sweet oranges.</p>
<p>Continue to move forward is a comfortable trek -butt road hiking route. The villagers said that there were many people who had hiraged here in previous years, and there were few people this year. At Yangti Watshukou, crossing the river, it was already more than 5 pm, and the elementary school was out of school. We waited for the passenger cars with elementary school students at 6:10. Elementary students got out of the car along the way. The windows were blowing in the cool mountain breeze, and the smoke floated in the countryside, and the sun was gentle. Yangti&rsquo;s bus can reach Yangshuo Bus Station, get off at the station, and ride his own electric car back to the homestay.</p>
<h3 id="heading"></h3>
<p>On May 1st, Yangshuo, two days before the rainy days cold, 13 to 23 degrees, wearing thick jackets and trousers. Later Tianqing became hot immediately, and it was 30 degrees. It is recommended to prepare long -sleeved pants, sunscreen coats, umbrellas, and non -slip sandals.</p>
<p>I try to eat with the owner of the inn. At other times, it is 15 bowl of Guilin rice noodles. The authentic rice noodles here do not have soup, it is mixed with powder, adding some sour beans and sour radish, it is delicious. There are three kinds of meat for signature rice noodles, the most expensive, usually 15-20 yuan; I often eat pot-roasted rice noodles, 10-15 yuan.</p>
<p>After 7 nights in Yangshuo, the three homestays of the three Ai Piguet welcomed the accommodation, but they still recommended that the homestay owner loved to play, and would organize a lot of interesting activities.</p>
<p>Near Yangshuo County, a electric car will be very convenient. Whether you go to Baisha Town to rush the collection or play in the old county and villages, it is not a matter of 20 kilometers back and forth. It is estimated that the mileage can reach up to 40 kilometers and the speed can reach 45 kilometers.</p>
<p>There are passengers at Yangshuo Bus Station to Xingping Town and Yangti Township. The price is within 20 yuan, and there are many times. Not far from the bus station, there are Yangshuo Fengming Tourism Distribution Center. The high -speed rail dedicated line can reach Yangshuo Station.</p>
<p>Yangshuo County People&rsquo;s Hospital can be tested at nucleic acids, and Baisha Town Health Center can also be one of 8 yuan per person.</p>
<p>If you experience the bamboo raft, you must choose the Dragon River section and pay attention to the wet shoes. On the Lijiang River, there is a motor electric plastic raft, and the sound is noisy.</p>
