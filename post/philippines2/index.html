      <p>At less than 6:30 on Sunday, I woke up from the bed, picked up the mobile phone on the table, checked the matters to be handled today, and waited for the alarm clock at 6:30.</p>
<p>At less than 7:30, I was already sitting on the bench of the restaurant, carrying a schoolbag, there were scholarship for breakfast, half a bottle of hot boiling water, and a Chinese novel borrowed to me by Taiwan classmates. Finally, Teacher Zelle came in. &ldquo;Wait a while, I drink a cup of coffee.&rdquo; Saying her tearing the coffee powder bag, bent over to push the water coffee in front of the water dispenser.</p>
<p>The rain was crackling outside. Recently, there seems to be a typhoon passing. This week&rsquo;s rain is intermittent. After a while, the slippers under the eaves are poured down.</p>
<p>Zelle and I walked out of the courtyard and stopped the car on the road at the door. &ldquo;The storms are very large in the past few days. The tourist pier on this road has been suspended, so it is difficult to wait until the passenger three -wheel wheels. We can only take a motorcycle.&rdquo; The passenger tricycle is usually 3 yuan per person. The car costs 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Zelle and motorcycle driver said a few words in dialects, and then we got on the car. I was sandwiched in the middle, and Zelle sat behind me. I supported the umbrella and barely covered our hair and upper body.</p>
<p>After riding for 5 or 6 minutes, the rain was getting bigger and bigger, and we stopped on the road to hide from the rain. At this time, we have reached a more lively position on the island. We paid half of the motorcycle money and took the tricycle with compartment. The tricycle drove for another 7 or 8 minutes, passed by the center area, and moved forward for a short section. Zelle stopped the driver.</p>
<p>Our destination is here, just 8 o&rsquo;clock. Teacher Zelle took me to a Christian church to worship. Teacher Zelle at the restaurant last night said that she would worship the day. I just passed a church by the beach at night, so I asked her if she was the one. Churchian, invites me to come together tomorrow.</p>
<p>When we walked into the church, a middle -aged man with a white clothes was thinking on the small table on the right of the podium. &ldquo;Is he talking about English?&rdquo; After listening for a while, I asked Zelle. &ldquo;No, he is talking about the Philippines mixed with English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are sitting on a row of benches in the middle of the podium. Each row of benches will reach back a small platform backwards to put down our arms. When the person behind is kneeling, we can hold this small platform in the front seat. There is a long leather kneeling pad on the ground in front of the bench, which has a mottled cracks on it.</p>
<p>At a certain time, a team of young people came in in the door of the church. &ldquo;They are Altar Boy, and they will assist the pastor to complete the ceremony.&rdquo; Zelle said to my ear.</p>
<p>A green robe pastor did not know where to step on the podium, sitting on the high -back chair in the middle, and a Altar Boy adjust the position of the electric fan facing him. Another young man with a white clothes walked to the desk on the left side of the podium, rolled the Bible, and selected paragraphs to share with everyone. The two monitors on the wall lit up at the same time, reminding the English prayer, and everyone recited them together.</p>
<p>When the sacrament was sent, several men in white came with a plate, and Christians in the crowd ranked several columns to receive a small piece of bread to eat. The plate of the sacred meal finally recovered in front of the Rev. Green Clothes, and the pastor poured the bread crumbs in each plate into a bronze cup and drank it with water. The men in white took the plate.</p>
<p>Woman wearing white clothes in the middle, holding a long rod, and white cloth pocket at the top of the long rod. When they passed a long chair, they flattened the long rod and sent the cloth to us. &ldquo;This is used for collecting donations, you can freely.&rdquo; I followed Zelle and put the change in the wallet. When the woman sent the cloth to us for the second time, I was a little wondering. Zelle and I said, &ldquo;The first time is to help the poor and do donations of good deeds. The second time is to donate to the church&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>Pray. Rev. Green Clothes walked down the podium, a group of people surrounded him, and a bottle in his hand shaking his hand and throwing water drops out. &ldquo;This is Shengshui, we can get blessings.&rdquo; So we also stepped forward to accept the blessings of the Holy Water.</p>
<p>Zelle pointed to the position of the second floor. The sound of music in the church was not the music, but the singing class on the second floor sang in real time. I realized that when I prayed in the middle, I turned my head and looked up. Sure enough, I saw 4 or 5 young people on the second floor. There was another person in front of them seemed to be instructed.</p>
<p>When we walked out of the church, the rain had stopped. The air in the early morning was cool and refreshing. Zelle took a tricycle back to school.</p>
