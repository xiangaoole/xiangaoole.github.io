      <p>On June 30, 2023, Shenzhen, China, in the afternoon of Friday, looked back at a small 10 -square -meter room that had lived for 4 years. There are also movie posters bought by Taobao, and the desktop has been cleaned up. Seeing that it resumed the empty appearance, I felt a little panicked. This small room that had lived for 4 years has no longer belonging to me. In this city, country, and even the planet, I will start a section of a certain place where there is no place. The journey.</p>
<br>
<p>That pot of green dill was bought in the summer of 2020. It was when I first left, and I picked it on the night market street. Since then, it has lived with me for almost 3 years. When I pulled it out of the basin, it brought out the whole pot of soil together. It studied everywhere in the cramped small flower pot. There were several laps on the outer side of the soil. Drilling the water pores and looking for soil out.</p>
<p>I pulled it out of the flower pot, with the soil in the basin, and threw it to the high place, it fell into the grass on the soil slope. You are free, I say it to it.</p>
<br>
<p>24 hours later, the plane arrived at Manila, the capital of the Philippines. I waited for the next journey to the airplane of Catkland at the terminal. I will report to the Language School tomorrow and start English for 4 weeks.</p>
<p>After experiencing a series of transportation -taxi, the speedboat from Shenzhen to Hong Kong airport, the airport transfer rail transit, the medium -sized passenger aircraft from Hong Kong to Manila, the airport transfer buses, the small aircraft from Manila to Catkland, to the small on the dock The tricycle, the ferry to Boracay, a large tricycle, at 9 o&rsquo;clock in the evening on July 1, finally arrived at a youth hostel on the Philippines.</p>
<p>The next morning, go to the business hall of the island center to apply for a Philippine mobile phone card, and then use offline map navigation to the language school to report. A staff member heard the door bell and told me that no one in the school on Sunday was brought to the dormitory area across the street.</p>
<p>There is a red flower blooming at the door of the dormitory, opening the white iron door, which is like a garden. There are many mango trees and other green plants. Two ladies and two children enthusiastically greeted me through the open living room. They were Taiwanese families who came to school one week in advance.</p>
<br>
<p>There are currently two types of courses in language schools. One is for children&rsquo;s summer camps (unique to summer vacation). There are language learning and outdoor activities throughout the day, including three meals and accommodation; the other is English training for adults. Choose different lessons for learning goals and freely match accommodation and ordering according to needs.</p>
<p>My course is the second type, 4 days every five days, 4 lessons every day, 50 minutes each lesson, a grammar group lesson, one reading group lesson, and two -to -one special spoken communication. Take 3 lessons in the morning, take lunch in the school, take 1 lesson in the afternoon, and you can arrange freely after 2 pm.</p>
<p>All the Taiwanese families who come to the summer camp are all from the Taiwanese families. The students participating in adult courses are from different countries and regions, such as Japan, Switzerland, Spain, and Russia. Like me, there is only one Zhejiang girl who comes with her father. She takes 3 lessons and goes to the golf training after lunch every day. Her skin is very sunny.</p>
<br>
<p>Boracay is a well -known tourist attraction in the Philippines. The narrow island that moves north and south makes you can see unobstructed sea sunset on the soft and blue beaches of the west coast. This is also one of the safest and highest prices in the Philippines. A bowl of dolphin ramen in a Japanese restaurant that can see the sunset on the beach requires 45 yuan, but if you avoid the beach, you are willing to go to the local restaurants on the street to eat You can eat a rich dinner of one meal, two bowls of rice.</p>
<p>The beautiful sea views and friendly islanders have attracted many foreign tourists. The principal of my language school is a Canadian who was attracted. He founded this language school in 2005 and has lived here for 15 years. When I asked the teacher in the reading class, Steve, why he chose to stay in Boracay instead of other countries in Southeast Asia, he said it was because of friendly people here.</p>
<br>
<p>English is the second official language of the Philippines. Children start English from the last semester of the first grade of elementary school, and most of the courses of higher education use English professors. According to the impression of the Philippine teachers, most people&rsquo;s language familiarity is the local dialect, English, and finally the Philippines. Most Filipino adults can use simple English to communicate. The Philippines is the country with the highest popularity in English in Asian countries, and the accent of English is closest to standard pronunciation.</p>
<p>My two -to -one courses are Philippines, one of which is an English teacher in a public elementary school. He comes here to teach English part -time in the summer vacation. Usually he will prepare a short article, let me read it aloud, and then this is this. The topic of the article asked my views, such as &ldquo;what kind of lifestyle pursuing&rdquo; and &ldquo;whether to eat breakfast&rdquo;; another teacher is similar to me and will talk to me about many daily lives of the Philippines, such as school education system, the Philippines, the Philippines Legal policies for divorce and abortion.</p>
<p>The teacher of the grammar class is giving us 5 students in terms of terms. We need to take turns to complete the practice of sentences in the classroom. These learning contents are actually included in the English courses of high school students in mainland China, so it is more like reviewing for me. And application.</p>
<p>I like reading lessons. The article selected by Steve is very interesting. For example, &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; discusses the impact of travel on the locals, and &ldquo;Conspiracy on the Death of the Princess Diana&rdquo; tells the rumors of Princess Diana&rsquo;s death. The five students in the classroom come from 5 different countries and regions, so you can hear the story of everyone&rsquo;s own country. Steve is also a teacher who can perform a very physical performance (he is a guitarist). He can perform various emotions with vivid performances, such as how to pretend to be a stomachache to escape from a surging dialogue.</p>
<br>
<p>What makes me feel particularly interesting in the small class group lesson is that unlike in the large class, there are usually only individual students who have the opportunity to speak. Here, every classmate will take turns to speak. There is a feeling that each individual is respected. And everyone must learn to listen to others.</p>
<p>If I have a word that I don&rsquo;t understand, I will be proposed immediately. For example, the word &ldquo;travel bug&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t understand what it means in class, the teacher will ask other students to help explain it, and will give it an example, and let us 5 students answer BUG &ldquo;, why?</p>
<p>Of course, this way of learning is not as efficient as a problem, but I like it very much. I think it will allow you to enjoy the happiness of using English communication better, and in the process, you will unknowingly learn to learn English words by using other understandable alternative explanations, not to study dictionary. Now I prefer to check words instead of the European dictionary, because ChatGPT is like a classmate in the course, it will explain and give examples in English.</p>
<p>And coming to an island that almost everyone can speak English to learn English, it is like entering a comprehensive English corner. Whether you participate in the encyclopedia knowledge at the bar, watch the sunset on the cruise, eat barbecue in a Korean restaurant, or take a walk home after dinner, you can come to an English exchange anytime, anywhere.</p>
