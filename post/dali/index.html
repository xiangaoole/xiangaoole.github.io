<p>第一部分介绍大理吸引我的地方和人，第二部分分享我收集的旅行信息。</p>
<h2 id="part1有趣的地方和人">Part1：有趣的地方和人</h2>
<p>When I came to the ancient city of Dali, I visited the writer Chen Xiaochen on Douban on the bell floor of the bell on Guangwu Road. He listened to the digital tourist on Douban Yeye&rsquo;s on -site lecture on 706 Dali, and the player of the player &ldquo;The Wind Wind&rdquo;. Dali in September, I encountered Roy and SUE, who was passing by the B station when I ate in my dinner, was a large -scale star chase scene. Not to mention other interesting people you meet. Dali is a place where a person is very close to people. I participated in several activities and entered a few WeChat groups. I ate a few more meals in the same restaurant. Before you.</p>
<p>Dali is a place of slow life. There is a story that may be a bit extremely extreme. A friend ordered a large plate of chicken in a restaurant. The boss was eating, so he let me wait for more than 20 minutes. There is a well -known burger shop in the ancient town of Shaxi. The boss only makes about 20 beef burgers every day. The guests who come late can only eat other ones, or make an appointment for the next day. I came here for two meals. I did n’t eat beef burgers when I arrived at the meal. I was eaten the next day.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you come to Dali and want to get to know some friends who may be able to talk quickly, then you can participate in some activities. &ldquo;[Dali is good at] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7W727q2_oxguf27gart4oa)%22">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7W727q2_oxguf27gart4oa)&quot;</a> This public account summarized many recent activities near Dali ancient city, and we must pay attention. Below I also introduce some of the interesting places I have encountered.</p>
<h3 id="本素拾堂">本素拾堂</h3>
<p>*(The return visit in September 2022, the master opened the passenger, and the cafeteria turned to a pair of mother and daughter who believed in Buddhism. She would play the chanting sound when eating.</p>
<p>This is a vegetarian restaurant, located next to Yiduo Cafe in Mujimou. The boss is called &ldquo;Brother&rdquo; and an old Douban user and northeast. My half of my food is here, this is the &ldquo;late night cafeteria&rdquo; in my heart. Tourists who come to dinner often can&rsquo;t find who the boss is, and other diners will guide where to scan the code, and take a few meal boxes, where is the paper cup.</p>
<p>The elder brother often lay on a lounge chair at the door, wearing a pair of glasses, reading a book in the sun, and having a cooked customer. I can often encounter some familiar faces and sounds when eating, and they are often familiar with it.</p>
<p>I especially like the oil poem written on the small blackboard in front of the restaurant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A small shop, two beings. <br/>
Three meals are vegetarian, cycle of four seasons. <br/>
In the end of Old Cangshan, sprinkle Bone Erhai Lake. <br/>
生死放下，聚散由之。</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="space-42">Space 42</h3>
<p><em>(In 2021, Sister Lu came to Wutongshan, Shenzhen, and started online. In 2022, the Feidenquis course teacher Dora went round and forth in Shenzhen and Dali. .)</em></p>
<p>Public account &ldquo;[space 42] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/njgen5o76bugg3tjaewa)%22">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/njgen5o76bugg3tjaewa)&quot;</a>. Space 42 is located in the third phase of the landscape community near Dali University outside the ancient city. It takes half an hour to ride a small battery for each time. In this way, I often come to participate in the event. For the first time, I have been exposed to improvisation, free chanting, Ukraine, and Ferdenquis aware of the course. This is a world full of spirituality and tenderness.</p>
<p>When the language stops, feel when it feels. When we pay attention to the awareness of the body and the vibration of the sound, everything begins to be different. Here is a special feeling to give me a special feeling. When the guide lets us do a movement, I feel that I have been allowed to do bad, allowed to cooperate, allowed to fall asleep. Instead, I can play as much as possible to try those who are not used to move.</p>
<p>At the end of the first time I came here to participate in the event, the hostess Lu gave me a hug to be flattered; at the end of the last time I participated in the event, Lu learned that I was leaving Dali, and gave me a hug again. Essence</p>
<h3 id="706-dali-living-laboratory">706 (Dali) Living Laboratory</h3>
<p>Public account &ldquo;[706 Dali] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gat52tqz3xet-glhkwv0uw)%22">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gat52tqz3xet-glhkwv0uw)&quot;</a>. 706 Dali was officially operated on December 1, 2020. It is located in a small yard on Yincang Road. It is interesting to rent and lease to the 706 community specifications and organize sharing and lectures. At that time, a group of interesting young people were gathered here, including digital tourist Yeye (public account and podcast &ldquo;[not working commune] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fw4c1qro2ckafkmqqqqqnbb7w)%22)">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fw4c1qro2ckafkmqqqqqnbb7w)&quot;)</a>, and Danniel (public account &ldquo;[Digital Woman Intelligence Bureau] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s/sfoewac1-gg1-ryn6pcixa))">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s/sfoewac1-gg1-ryn6pcixa))</a>, as well The kind of excitement when he was childhood), former Google programmer Ren (he said, &ldquo;To the extreme of what you like, the opportunity will come to you&rdquo;) and so on. Here I have held lectures on digital tourism, South American travel, science and cognition, and career, and have benefited a lot.</p>
<h3 id="book">Book</h3>
<p>Public number &ldquo;[Physician Book] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3jonszf5eiurevssexxvsg)%22">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3jonszf5eiurevssexxvsg)&quot;</a>. If you like to read, don&rsquo;t miss this. The book of the science comes from donations, and the quality is very high. I read &ldquo;You Be a Bird Flying to Your Mountain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Buried Giants&rdquo;. The tables and chairs and atmospheres here are very close to the library, suitable for reading and office quietly (that is, a bit cold in winter). The physics is also a inn. If you donate 5 books, you can stay for free for free.</p>
<h3 id="dali-september">Dali September</h3>
<p>Public account &ldquo;[Dali September] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qiboeyzzj_ke-6_3tc0tww)%22">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qiboeyzzj_ke-6_3tc0tww)&quot;</a>. If you like music, such as Winter Bulu, Jazz, Bruce or some pioneers, come here to try it. This is a long bar in the ancient city. It is famous in the long -resident group. It is located in a small yard that is difficult for tourists to find. Essence The wine in the bar is cheap, and a cup of gold soup is 35 yuan.</p>
<p>Performance usually starts at 8:30 in the evening on Friday and weekends. Some are free and some charges. The musicians in the wooden house were crowded together forgotten, and the audience squeezed on the grass pads to listen relaxing. Someone in the yard was baking fire. Someone was talking. The night was gentle and the stars flickered.</p>
<h3 id="dali-sheet-single-art-factory">Dali Sheet Single Art Factory</h3>
<p>This is a factory area south of the ancient city of Dali. Because it is separated by a military management zone in the middle of it, it is at the end of a small road. It is also rare for tourists.</p>
<p>My favorite in the factory area is the climbing wall transformed from the corridor. The single climbing is only 30 yuan. It is open every May and 6th in the afternoon. Looking at the rock climbing here, I feel happy and happy. envious.</p>
<p>Another place I like is the more famous dolphin Ade Shop (public account &ldquo;[Dolphin Ade Shop] (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qyshjxnrh7dqbfxyw4y5qqq)%22)">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qyshjxnrh7dqbfxyw4y5qqq)&quot;)</a>, half of the book area, half of the book area, half of the book area In the coffee area, some cultural and creative works are also sold in the book area. The book area is not allowed to bring the book area to the coffee area, but there is a small bookshelf in the coffee area for free. If you buy a cup of coffee, it is very comfortable to sit here for an afternoon. In the bookstore, there is a book &ldquo;Under Cangshan&rdquo; that I can&rsquo;t buy online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the real society, &ldquo;mainstream values&rdquo; are devoured us every second, turning us into various &ldquo;categories&rdquo;. What is even more terrible is that after we really enter the category of &ldquo;success&rdquo;, happiness has not come, and boring and emptiness will come one after another. Because from the beginning of our extremely utilitarian education, to continuous &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; for &ldquo;success&rdquo; after entering the society, there is no time to find time and space for interest. As a result, the most boring and pale well -off generation in this country has appeared.</p>

<h3 id="four-seasons-market-store-second-floor">（(Four Seasons Market Store) Second Floor</h3>
<p><em>(The return visit in September 2022, it has been closed, the four seasons market is deserted, and the toilet is sealed.)</em></p>
<p>When I first arrived in Dali in November, the Elk Market was still barren. It has been repaired before New Year&rsquo;s Day. There are slides, grasslands, and exquisite small shops. There are often bonfires at night, which is worth visiting.</p>
<p>Dabing&rsquo;s hut (Four Seasons Market Store) is in the elk market. The first floor is a bar, and the second floor is a 24 -hour free open library. The light on the second floor is particularly good, and it will be exposed to the sun in the afternoon like an oven. There are many books and miscellaneous books. There are many types of literary names of various literatures. There are many categories of novels. There are long tables to work, and there are sofas to lie down. It is suitable for bookworms to read here. The old book pile in.</p>
<h3 id="适合办公学习的地方">适合办公学习的地方</h3>

<h2 id="part-2大理旅居信息">Part 2：大理旅居信息</h2>
<p>If you are already excited and want to come to Dali life for a while, then the following is some of the living information I collected, I hope it will be helpful to you.</p>
<p>The ancient city of Dali faced Erhai Lake, Cangshan in the west, went to the south, and went north to Xizhou. There are 4 gates in east and west, north and south are Erhai Gate, Cangshan Gate, South Gate and North Gate. It is easy to distinguish the orientation in the ancient city, and look up &ldquo;seeing Cangshan leisurely&rdquo;, which is the west.</p>
<h3 id="气候">气候</h3>
<p>I came to Dali in winter (November to January), and I also experienced the coldest days in Dali since 2016. The biggest feature of Dali&rsquo;s climate is that the temperature difference is large and the ultraviolet strength is high. Here you will strongly feel that &ldquo;the growth of all things depends on the sun&rdquo;. Most of the time is a blue sky. There will be a large white cloud on the top of Cangshan. The temperature of the day is 20-4 degrees Celsius, which is mainly determined by whether the sunlight is sufficient. Because the sunlight ultraviolet rays are very strong, students who mind black must pay attention to sunscreen.</p>
<p>Walking or dazing under the sun, I will wear a warm underwear and a sports sweater; the clouds cover, it will soon be cold, and add a shake pill coat. Most of the time, there is no need for down jackets, but it is necessary to bring one piece. The coldest time is enough, and it is also used to board Cangshan. On January 11th and 12th, 2021, the coldest days I met. The temperature was about 5- -1 degrees Celsius. The snow seeds were in the ancient city. I wore a low down jacket and a scarf.</p>
<h3 id="have-a-meal">Have a meal</h3>
<p>Eating alone, my choice is mainly rice noodles, vegetarian self -service, and small fried rice. The meal is 10-15 yuan. I went to dinner:</p>
<p>-Yi Ran Hall: There is a self -service fast rice (5 yuan meals+1 yuan paper bowl) for lunch and dinner. It will play the &ldquo;Amitabha&rdquo; chanting background music. You can eat full, and the taste is relatively simple.
-The place where I get the most, lunch is a vegetarian buffet, 13 yuan per person, with soy milk, black rice porridge, and sometimes I can meet bread slices and egg fried rice. There are eggs, the others are vegan, are northeast, very delicious; dinner is noodles, about 10 yuan, some noodles have green onions, you can add fried eggs.
-The Yunfeng Yao Rice Noodle: Wangzi Braised Pork Rice Noodles, Wangzi is Mao Bloody, the taste is delicious, and the big bowl is only 12 yuan.
-Original Earth Chicken Rice Noodles: Erhai Gate of the Ancient City, Chicken Soup is superb, and a large bowl of native chicken noodles is 15 yuan.
-In the north -south private kitchen: The form is very similar to Japanese materials. The boss will cook under your eyelids and make it in front of you. It looks very high -level but the price is relatively close to the people. The simple package is 28 yuan to 40 yuan. The boss likes to cook and seriously do what he likes.
-The halal snack: It is also very famous. The boss said that &ldquo;color wood&rdquo; means &ldquo;hello&rdquo;. Qingshu beef rice noodles (beef slices), red -roasted beef rice noodles (a lot of beef pieces), dried fried rice, beef sausage fried rice, chicken intestine fried rice is delicious; there are many old customers who like to eat braised beef beef rice, I will feel a bit salty It&rsquo;s right.
-Suixin Garden Halal Snack: A humble shop, the restaurant is full of locals, and chicken fried rice (12 yuan) is delicious than wood.
-The local fried local fried local fried in the Dali September Bar: Back to the pot, the meat is really fragrant, 14 yuan.
-Afang Street Supermarket (Yu&rsquo;er Store): Packing 10 yuan for two plain and two vegetarian, you can also eat 15 yuan in the store.
-Beimen Cai Market: The lowest price in the ancient city, the fruit is delicious and cheap.
-Sunan Gate Green Yu Farmers Market: Outside the south gate of the ancient city: there are many foods: lemon chicken, Xiao Yang chicken feet, Yang&rsquo;s first volume of powder.</p>
<h3 id="长租">长租</h3>
<p>If you stay in the inn, the monthly rent is between 800 and 1800. 800 ~ 1200 close to the usual standard room, a large bed of 1.5m, independent bathroom, small tables and small stools, public washing machines, kitchens, top of the building; The table. Of course, these are the prices of tourism off -season, and some inn can increase prices in the peak tourist season.</p>
<p>Some long -term rental information of Dali can be found in the Douban group &ldquo;Love Dali&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dali Rental House&rdquo;. You can also rent for a few days first, and then inspect the inn in the field after you come. There are many inn in the ancient city of Dali. In addition, there are inn, around the ancient city. Seeing a lot of leases on Douban is still near the south gate and near Erhai Gate.</p>
<h3 id="出行">出行</h3>
<p>If you travel in the ancient city of Dali, walk from south to north, from east to west for about 20 minutes. If the activity is frequent, you can rent a small electric vehicle. I rent a Harbin electric vehicle. The monthly rent is 169 yuan. It can ride more than ten kilometers and charge it at the inn. There is no bicycle sharing in the ancient city, and the Huanhai Greenway in Erhai Lake is available.</p>
<p>The ancient city of Dali went to the country, and most cars started from Xiaguan County, and could be found on Ctrip.</p>
<p>Dali Ancient City went to Lijiang: There is a direct train to Shimonatsu City. It is said that you can show off the passenger cars on the Dali Line Highway. The window on the car hanging on the car on the car is hung on Lijiang. It will stop.</p>
<p>Dali Ancient City went to the ancient town of Shaxi: Shimonoseki has a shuttle bus to the passenger station of Jianchuan County, once every 20 minutes. I stopped the car on the Dali Line Highway; when I arrived at the Passenger Station of Jianchuan County, there was a green small van on the right side of the passenger station. Two passenger cars are the most saved, with a total of 55 yuan (40+15). If you want to save trouble, you can consult in the Lanling Pavilion Hotel in the ancient city of Dali. There are charters directly to Lanling Pavilion Hotel in Shaxi Ancient Town. It is said that it is more than 100.</p>
<p>The ancient city of Dali went to Jizao Mountain: Shimonoseki has a shuttle bus to the entrance to the entrance of Jizao Mountain, which can be purchased by Ctrip. However, the time to return the bus was too early. I met the journey at 3 pm. If the mountain is not climbed throughout the process, it is enough to take the ropeway and the sightseeing car. Like I climbed up the mountain, I played for a long time, and I went to the entrance until 6 o&rsquo;clock. In the end, several people chartered the car and returned to Xiaguan City (70 yuan per person), and then took the bus from Xiaguan to the ancient city of Dali.</p>
<h3 id="环洱海">环洱海</h3>
<p>Erhai Lake is not a sea, but it is more beautiful than many sea views. This is due to its mountains, light, and clouds.</p>
<p>The clean -seas roads are built along the Erhai Line. On the one hand, there is the Haixi Line, and on the other side, there are the east of the Huanhai. In the middle, there are some sections of the road. The management of the Haixi Line Greenway near the ancient city is very strict. Only the cycling of cycling is allowed to prohibit electric vehicles and other motor vehicles; the Haixi Line green road can also ride an electric car; Most sections are red bicycle lanes, and luxury sports cars are common on roads, large trucks and tourists on the road.</p>
<p>The closest seaside to the ancient city is the Cai Village Pier, and the south is the more famous Longxi Terminal. Here is very suitable for taking a family picnic on the grass in the afternoon, a large piece of grassland, the brownish yellow woods by the water, the bright sunlight shoots the beam through the clouds, and you can hear the sound of water and birds quietly, as if you are in a fairy tale world. Of course, these three Huanhai Green Road also attracted many tourists to take pictures and punch cards. The Dragon Terminal often hovers from seagulls.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Haidong Line can see the Cangshan Erhai Lake, the sun and the clouds are just right, and the scenery is very good. Shuanglang Ancient Town is a beautiful attraction. In addition to the famous Sun Palace, the architecture here is also very famous, suitable for taking pictures. Both mountains and Hai are great backgrounds, so there are also many newcomers who take wedding photos in Haidong Line.</p>
<p>The entire Erhai Ring Line is about 128 kilometers. The ride -riding car departs from Erhai Gate to the north. , Digging Pier, Little Putuo Island, Luo Tsui Peninsula, Jintou Island, along the airport to the city, Erhai Park, and finally returned to the city from the south gate. It lasted for 11 and a half hours, departed at 9 am, and returned at 8:30 in the evening. At about 7 pm, it will be dark. After dark, the cycling will be cold, and gloves need to keep gloves warm. I was exhausted to return to the ancient city from Xiaguan City, and I would also have a pain in the ride for a long time.</p>
<p>It is not recommended that most people ride, because physical conditions and food reserves are needed, most sections are actually boring. They must also squeeze and squeeze them with large cars. In the ancient city, there were electric vehicles leased by large electricity, and the price was not cheap, but the ring was fast and relaxed. It could stop at any time when encountering good scenery. It is recommended to use ordinary tourists.</p>
<h3 id="deng-cangshan">Deng Cangshan</h3>
<p>The highest part of Cangshan is 4,000 meters above sea level, and there are 3 ropeways from south to north. Neutronous ropeways are almost in a straight line as the North City Wall of the Ancient City. Washing the Malitan ropeway and the ancient city South City Wall are in a straight line. After passing through the Tianlong Babu Film and Television City, the sensor is the farthest, usually as the starting station of tourists climbing.</p>
<p>The most classic boarding route: Sensing Ropeway-Xima Tan Ropeway Station-Mountain Top-Marta Caudi Way down-Tianlong Babu Film and Television City. <code>Sensing ropeways</code> to the mountainside, along the lack of the jade belt, to the middle station of the Malang Roperway, take the Malitan ropeway to the top of the mountain, wearing a down jacket at the Cangshan at an altitude of 4000 meters, and then take the horses. Lotteryway to <code>Tianlong Babu Film and Television City</code>, finally returned to the ancient city. The top of the mountain is nearly 4000 meters, and a down jacket is required. You can also rent it on the mountain. Students with plateau reactions remember to buy a bottle of portable oxygen tanks under the mountain. (When I went to climb Cangshan in late November 2020, because of the landslide of the mountains, the middle station and the lower stop of the Malitan ropeway were closed, and I could not go to the film and television city)</p>
<p>The other is the Yuzhao Road Yunyou route: Senteng Ropeway-Yugai Road-Zhonghe Temple-Zhonghe Ropeway-March Street. If you are more interested in walking after walking around, you can not take the Malaysian Roper Way to stand up the mountain, but continue to walk along the <code>Yugai Road&quot; to Zhonghe Temple </code>, sit down the mountain in neutral ropeway. The whole jade belt road is about 11.5 kilometers. Everyone must consider the time, because the last shift of the neutral ropeway is issued at 4:30, and the ropeway is very slow. The path is directly below the ropeway.</p>
<p>The reason why many people choose to start from the Tongtong Temple ropeway is because the attractions are the most, and there are very few scenic spots in neutralization. The Internet celebrity punch the point <code>Silent Zhao Yue</code> is at the entrance of the ropeway of the Tongtong Temple. There are many fleshy plants in the silent photos. The whole pattern is small and exquisite. Many tourists will come here at 11:30 noon. Otherwise, it will be punished and washed the dishes. After lunch, start the afternoon climbing journey from the Tongtong Copleway. Taxi can go directly to the silence, and take a large slope of mountain roads to save energy.</p>
<p>The above is my first experience in climbing on Cangshan. I don&rsquo;t like the flatness of the jade belt. Mountaineering shoes will be easy to get tired after walking on such a flat road for a long time. The experience of the second climbing mountain was more comfortable. At that time, under the leadership of the familiar partners, we went up the mountain from the road of Santa, all the way to a thick pine needle. When entering the forest, the wind blows Song Tao. We share experiences and fruits, so quiet afternoon. When we went to Yu Bao Road, we walked to Zhonghe Temple, walking down the mountain from Zhonghe Temple, through the gravity and the buffer of the mountaineering stick, down the mountain is extremely fast.</p>
<p>If possible, walking in Tu Road is more recommended. However, the temperature difference between Cangshan is large, especially the route above the jade belt has certain risks, and it needs to be led by guide. Forest fire prevention responsibilities are important, please do not bring fire to the mountain.</p>
<h3 id="shaxi-ancient-town">Shaxi Ancient Town</h3>
<p>After coming to the ancient city of Dali for a month, someone kept telling me that there were two places worth going in Dali, one was the ancient town of Shaxi and the other was Jizao Mountain. Finally, at the right time, I set off. The transportation method from the ancient city of Dali to Shaxi has been introduced in the &ldquo;travel&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>The ancient town of Shaxi in Jianchuan County is a place that is more avoided than the ancient city of Dali. Some people say that it is like the ancient city of Dali a few years ago. There are not many inn in the ancient town. It is concentrated in the northeast area. Other parts are the living places of residents in the town. It is like a small town that I grew up since I was a child. , Crowded with people selling various agricultural and sideline products, but the markets in the ancient town of Shaxi often see foreigners, and Chinese guides explained to them what products they sold here.</p>
<p>If you want to experience a secluded pastoral life, it is very suitable. The ancient town is full of quaint houses everywhere. The ancient theater is very beautiful and easy to take pictures. The east side of the ancient town has an arched Yujin Bridge. It takes 1 kilometer on the countryside, and it has reached the relatively popular &ldquo;Pioneer Shaxi Bai Tubu&rdquo;, the earth -colored Shaxi red wall, and the tall bookshelf in the bookstore is full. There is a dazzling book, there is a cafe next to it. In a day, you can visit the corner of the ancient town. At night, it is shrouded in the night. Only the lights of the inn are left. You can see the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>The next day, I don&rsquo;t know where to go, just basking in the sun on the top of the youth hostel, listening to the crowd of the lambs in the house downstairs, next to the tiles of jelly tiles in the neighbor&rsquo;s house, sending it. Stay for a while. Walking to Yujin Bridge, slowly walking north along the stream, forgetting the time of passing.</p>
<p>In the Northeast area, there are also some interesting shops. For example, the beef burger of the &ldquo;西 12 Western Restaurant&rdquo;, station B UP said that the city said that it reminded him of the taste of Australia. Beef Hamburg only does about 20 every day, which is very sought -after and can make an appointment in advance. There is also the youth hostel that I have lived for two nights. The boss and his friends often play darts downstairs. They play very professional.</p>
<h3 id="鸡足山">鸡足山</h3>
<p>Jizu Mountain, Binchuan County is one of the top ten famous mountains in Buddhism, and the dojo of Gaye Bodhisattva. I don&rsquo;t know much about the specific significance. The way of transportation from the ancient city of Dali to Jizushan has been introduced in the &ldquo;travel&rdquo; section. Many temples and nuns on the mountain. If you take a sightseeing car and the ropeway to Jinding Temple throughout the process, you will miss a lot of temples on the road, including the Ga Ye Temple. You can take a sightseeing car and ropeway when you go up the mountain, and walk down the mountain, so that you can be physically and good at the attractions, although it may hurt your knees. I climbed into the golden top. I wonder if it was 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Many temples on the mountain can provide accommodation, can also eat fast meals, morning and evening classes. The accommodation conditions seen in the Gaye Temple are a bit similar to the youth hostel. Collective dormitory, single bed, electric blanket, and cheap. There is a lotus table on the side courtyard of the Ga Ye Hall, which looks extraordinarily Zen in the mountains. Just when I went, I saw a monk wearing a yellow cotton jacket and meditating his eyes in the sun.</p>
