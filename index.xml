      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had watched the film adapted by Taiwanese director Ang Lee. So when I found it on the shelf in the hotel at Penang, I chose it to be the next book to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is very interesting. And the book is dedicatedly divided into 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first part tells the background of the family. The father of Pi ran a zoo in India. Pi grew up in this zoo. This background information is lengthy but helpful for explaining the knowledge Pi has to deal with and tame a Bengal tiger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second part tells how the wreck happened to Pi and his amazing stories in the following 227 days on the sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last part is short but astonishing because it provides another cruel version of the story from the records of the officers who are investigating the wreck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast (PODCAST) is a form of audio programs similar to radio stations in ancient early days. Its production cost is lower than video content and higher than text content. Compared to reading text, it is much easier to listen to the podcasts. Compared with watching videos, it is easy for a podcast to get more in -depth and detailed insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the place where the podcast is most attractive to me is to accompany and nourish, just like sitting among a group of people, listening to them chatting, you can feel everyone’s voice and laughter through the sound, and feel the atmosphere of the conversation at the time. It is important that you can find a lot of interesting people through a favorite podcast and open a lot of interesting worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From listening to the monthly radio program updated by Miss F in 15 years in Netease Cloud Music, to listening to &amp;ldquo;Proud Form&amp;rdquo; on Himalayas, and then using a special podcast to use a &amp;ldquo;small universe&amp;rdquo; to listen to a large number of podcasts, I listen to the history of the podcast It has been more than 8 years. The podcast has had a lot of influence on me. &amp;ldquo;The Wind Wind said&amp;rdquo; has contributed that I went to Dali for 2 months after leaving in 2020. Digital tourist -related podcasts have contributed to my resignation in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some podcast programs that sound like you like, maybe you can also find your favorite show. (If there is no special explanation, all podcasts can listen to in the &amp;ldquo;Little Universe&amp;rdquo; APP.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. F&amp;rsquo;s radio stations belong to the humanities and social sciences. She is a professional news communication, and her mother is the host of a professional radio. Therefore, her podcasts have performed well in soundtracks, sound quality, editing and pronunciation. It is recommended to listen to Netease Cloud Music, because in addition to the exclusive programs broadcast by Netease Cloud Music, you can also see the anchor message and listening comments many years ago. As Miss F said, &amp;ldquo;interpret her own text with her own voice&amp;rdquo;, her podcast is written first and then interpreted, and each issue has a complete version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jade-的晚风说&#34;&gt;Jade 的“晚风说”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interviews with the most far -reaching podcasts on me, and there are a lot of interviews with people living in Dali, and have made historical records of the life history of many ordinary and interesting characters. The content of the podcast has been deleted by the anchor platform and cannot be listened to the small universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[E104 Pakistan | Please enjoy your ice and snow alone] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e104-94067266)&#34;&gt;https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e104-94067266)&lt;/a&gt;. Pakistani&amp;rsquo;s collection of poems is one of the few poems that I can read, as her poem collection cover said, &amp;ldquo;People say, soft people have wisdom. I don&amp;rsquo;t want wisdom, as long as it is soft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[E89 Huanzi | Before the emergence of the artificial uterus, equality of men and women is impossible] (&lt;a href=&#34;http://163cn.tv/qa2hn1)%22&#34;&gt;http://163cn.tv/qa2hn1)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by the news event of a female star at the time, discussed this sensitivity in depth. topic.

From this issue, I met a super -favorite psychedelic band Fulushou and a super favorite science fiction drama &amp;ldquo;Circle Story&amp;rdquo;. Later, I met a good friend who also liked this band in Dali.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[E50 Jade &amp;amp; Li Jianzhang] (&lt;a href=&#34;http://163cn.tv/el2id3)%22&#34;&gt;http://163cn.tv/el2id3)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Lao Li is a Dali burned pottery. For the first time, I saw such a sincere person. &amp;ldquo;True&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;Truthfulness and Beauty&amp;rdquo; is always the first place. &amp;ldquo;True&amp;rdquo; means cold and not abducted by morality and filial piety.
-Jade&amp;rsquo;s other periods of the great podcasts are stringing to other podcasts. For the convenience of listening, they are placed in the chapter of &amp;ldquo;proud and forgetful&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;small tavern&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;God love to play wealth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhang-xiaoyus-most-and-forget&#34;&gt;Zhang Xiaoyu&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Most and Forget&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang Xiaoyu is an investor from a financial professional. He can not only be able to learn the cat with spiritual bloggers, but also talk to mathematical enthusiasts, Bro Feng, and talk to psychology with psychological counselor Jane Lili. Talking about Bitcoin and meditation together with Jade, which also has the financial background, and created the first lesson of investment in &amp;ldquo;knowing and doing&amp;rdquo; with entrepreneur Meng Yan. At the same time, he wanted to create a decentralized form of education to popularize the popularity of basic logic to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[64: Remember Dark Said] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/636dcbb0165a494978cb)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/636dcbb0165a494978cb)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Dark Said is a note of Dark Side (Dark Noodles). This issue talks with the musician Chen Jingzhang from the transfer of professional transfers from finance to music, the dark side of the women felt in growth, and how to accept her dark side And used to create.

From the talked of tennis to investment philosophy with Meng Yan, as Buffett said, everyone must have their own internal scoring board, have their own evaluation criteria, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about others&amp;rsquo; evaluation, your opponent is you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[57 When you are ready, you are ready] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/5e74543a418a846c4e51e)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/5e74543a418a846c4e51e)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. And Jade&amp;rsquo;s second podcast, I just met the &amp;ldquo;Wind Wind&amp;rdquo; I met in this issue. How to let go of yourself and find the calmness of the soul. When I heard the ending song, I was walking on the mountain. The green trees in the distance from the field of vision stacked in the middle of the mountain space. The white clouds were embedded in the dark blue sky. It was in the evening. At that moment, it was super wonderful. When you are ready, the universe will respond to you. When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[53 Fantasy Drifting in the Central Age] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/5e74543a418a846c4e528)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/5e74543a418a846c4e528)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. And the first podcast of Jade. Talk about the dilemma, the middle -aged crisis, and the spiritual experience.&lt;/li&gt;

He said, &amp;ldquo;To the extreme of what you like to do, the opportunity will naturally appear.&amp;rdquo; This sentence is still deeply inspired by me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[00 preface: the crisis of liberalism] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/5e74543a418a846c4e5c1)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/5e74543a418a846c4e5c1)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. The cool opening language provides a lot of scientific data links that lack in daily life. I am attracted to this podcast by this issue. Maybe starting from this issue, you will also like Zhang Xiaoyu&amp;rsquo;s podcasts and he wants to pass education through education. Created the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;有知有行的知行小酒馆&#34;&gt;有知有行的“知行小酒馆”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important financial knowledge popularized podcasts, produced by a well -known financial team. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to manage your deposit, you should be confused about whether you should buy a house, buy a stock or buy a fund, or whether the provident fund should be cash withdrawal, or whether to buy commercial medical insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[E76 I really hope!

Parents urge you to buy a house? Let them listen to this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[E51 has a baby, the financial freedom is gone?] (Https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/62FF3D24EB356CD549483ed0). Children are called &amp;ldquo;four -legged golden beast&amp;rdquo; by many people who want to be free to finance, but do they really spend money to raise children? This period of podcasts, &amp;ldquo;also talk about money&amp;rdquo; to talk to the post -90s mother who talks about the freedom of finance, to break the misunderstandings of many people on raising children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[E45 I really hope!

The 30 -year -old worker who is 30 years old &amp;ldquo;also talks about money&amp;rdquo;, guests are a tavern, and shared his experience in investment and financial management from university. Many people have a problem with the impression of financial freedom, &amp;ldquo;[also talk about money] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7kx0fxmdve1-rphvqjtl8w),%22&#34;&gt;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7kx0fxmdve1-rphvqjtl8w),&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; Fire (Financial Independence Retire Early) may not be a way worth it. The financial concept of &amp;ldquo;also talk about money&amp;rdquo; is not only high -quality on the domestic Internet, but after I start to listen to English podcasts, I find that his summary of investment books is better than the English author of the original book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[E12 Meng Yan: Please board the Chinese economy this big ship | stringing night late wind] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/60a7a0c6aa16889ab8f6669)&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/60a7a0c6aa16889ab8f6669)&lt;/a&gt;.

After graduating from college in 2016, Maruko started the first 8 -month global trip with 20,000 yuan, and walked through more than thirty countries in five continents in the next five years. She is a very interesting digital tourist. I found a lot of her podcasts to listen to and prepare for my global travel.
-This feels: [[EP3 Digital Tourist Interview-Wanzi: Creation itself is my motivation] (https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/64258e70179eec5331c2feef) &amp;ldquo;, I heard many periods of Interview, this issue is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Overy: &amp;ldquo;[Knowledge can be shared, wisdom cannot be shared] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/634f69fae67030aadb38f9f8)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/634f69fae67030aadb38f9f8)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. The book &amp;ldquo;Sidado&amp;rdquo; in Heisse tells the story of the Brahmin aristocratic youth, Siddo, to practice Buddha.

This podcast of King Elison, the digital tourist, has some inspiration for breaking the established living framework, and the comments on the top are also very interesting. Sometimes, changing yourself is better to change the environment, and you have to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ps-英文播客&#34;&gt;P.S. 英文播客&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to English podcasts is very good for improving English ability. A suggestion is to listen to the show you are most interested in. It is interesting enough to let you listen all the way. As long as you continue to listen, you will find the effect soon. Another suggestion is to pay attention to understanding the entire context rather than hearing each sentence. It may only be able to understand 30%of the content at first, but it can slowly increase to 80%. After listening to daily English interviews, the reading speed of English books will naturally increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Yeah, why not podcast] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/614B5100F0ADDE227e45676a)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/614B5100F0ADDE227e45676a)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;: A Chinese student&amp;rsquo;s life podcast is very fluent, and there are not too many raw words. Get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;THD American Chinese English Interview Show&amp;rdquo;: Three Chinese American Chinese interviews Chinese American Chinese who work in Shanghai, with more words, faster speech speed, and interesting topics. For example, &amp;ldquo;[120 Larry Wang: The Right Direction] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/643F89019361a4effb15)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/643F89019361a4effb15)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, talk about how to find a career direction in confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&amp;ldquo;waking up&amp;rdquo; app] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareopenaccess/sc5efdd8c)&#34;&gt;https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareopenaccess/sc5efdd8c)&lt;/a&gt;: Sam Harris is a neurologist who studies meditation from an atheist. Although Sam Harris also has a podcast, I recommend his meditation app. The introduction of meditation in the app is great, and it is easy to persist. It only takes 20 minutes, 10 minutes of meditation exercises every day, and the theoretical knowledge behind the meditation. There are many SAMs and other scientists and practitioners&amp;rsquo; soda dialogue and meditation courses in the entire app, which are clearly sorted out. The English of the introduction of meditation is not difficult, but some interviews will soon have a lot of new words, but after a long time, you can naturally understand most of the meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Indie Hacker”：独立开发者的访谈节目，可以听到很多著名开发者的观点。比如，Nomad List 的开发者 Pieter 的“&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/043-pieter-levels-of-nomad-list&#34;&gt;E04 Confronting Your Fears and Taking a Leap&lt;/a&gt;”。（小宇宙找不到，需要去官网收听）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;[The Fluent Show] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fluent.show/)%22&#34;&gt;https://www.fluent.show/)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;: The experience and method of foreign language learning, the English accent is very nice. (Can&amp;rsquo;t find the small universe, you need to listen to the official website)
-&amp;ldquo;Healthy Hacker&amp;rdquo;: The personal podcast of a Ruby programmer has stopped for 4 years, and he switched to music. A very fun programmer shared how to quickly remember the names of strangers, and how to share at the developer conference. &amp;ldquo;[11 Growing AS A Programmer] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.healthyhacker.com/2014/10/06/growing-A--ProGrammer/&#34;&gt;https://www.healthyhacker.com/2014/10/06/growing-A--ProGrammer/&lt;/a&gt;) tell story. (Can&amp;rsquo;t find the small universe, you need to listen to the official website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The English podcasts on the &amp;ldquo;Small Universe&amp;rdquo; are limited, and the new version has removed the function of adding podcasts through RSS, and some podcasts cannot add. So if you want to listen to more English podcasts, you can choose other apps, such as Overcast (IOS System Recommendation) and Pocket Casts (Recommended by Android System).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Things Done&lt;/em&gt; is a self-help book written by David Allen, which introduces some basic methods to arrange your daily tasks so that you can live a productive and stressless life. Here are my takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workflow of GTD consists of 5 steps (but remember, no need to finished all the steps at the same time):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;. Get all things out of your mind and write down them to your &lt;strong&gt;📥Inbox&lt;/strong&gt; at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify&lt;/strong&gt;. Find a time to check items in your inbox. &lt;em&gt;Is it actionable?&lt;/em&gt; If the stuff is just an idea that you might want to do but not now, you can leave it to a &lt;strong&gt;🔮someday&lt;/strong&gt; list. If it is a reference to materials helpful to your other goals, collect it to your &lt;strong&gt;📚Reference&lt;/strong&gt; system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organize&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Does your actionable item need more than one step?&lt;/em&gt; If so convert it to a &lt;strong&gt;⚙️Project&lt;/strong&gt; and find the fist step to do it. If a action can be done within 2 minutes, just do it (without considering its priority). &lt;em&gt;Does the step can be got about right now?&lt;/em&gt; If so put it into your &lt;strong&gt;⚡️Next&lt;/strong&gt; to-do list. Or else, arrange a future time to do it in your &lt;strong&gt;📅Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;🤝Delegate&lt;/strong&gt; it to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect&lt;/strong&gt;. Review your &lt;strong&gt;Inbox&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt; list, &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; actions weekly and reorganize them if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage&lt;/strong&gt;. Pick one to-do from your &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; to-do list and do it right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.website-files.com/608aecd1e643ecaa961a7a67/634cd40129d4e1311a6c292a_GTD%2001.png&#34; alt=&#34;The procedure for GTD&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After your organization, the stuff can be divided into these places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt; list: Desired results which require more than one action step. And you can organize your project support material by theme or topic inside the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; Actions list: Actions needs to be done &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;anytime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt; list: Projects waiting for other people’s responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calendar&lt;/strong&gt;: 1. time-specific actions such as an appointment that are going to happen on a specific time; 2. day-specific actions such as to call someone on his/her birthday; 3. day-specific information, such as directions for appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someday&lt;/strong&gt; list: Projects your don’t want to do recently, but you’d like to be reminded of them regularly on your weekly reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt; System: Reference to materials you may need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combine this method with Things 3 app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gtd-things3.png&#34; alt=&#34;GTD with Things 3 app&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you get up every morning, what you should do is to check your Today list and choose things needs to be done today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A note on your Bali travel experience</title>
      <link>https://haroldgao.com/post/bali/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/bali/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, I lived in Ubud, Bali for a month, and I was like [HTTPS://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wyty2tqthw8zhdkiptl1SQ). More often, just wandering in the paddy fields and houses. This article only summarizes some local life information and gives friends who are interested in traveling to Ubud for a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also traveling abroad for the first time, and I am traveling alone. As long as I have prepared in advance, I can solve it step by step when I encounter problems. All problems can be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-entry-preparation&#34;&gt;1. Entry preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Visa **: [Applying for electronic landing visa EVOA] (&lt;a href=&#34;http://xhslink.com/sqp8iu&#34;&gt;http://xhslink.com/sqp8iu&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;official website to apply for electronic landing visa EVOA&amp;rdquo;) is very convenient. You can get visa PDF files on the spot. You can enter a single entry within 3 months, stay for a maximum of 30 days, and you can renew another month in the local area. When you meet a friend&amp;rsquo;s entry, the outbound air ticket order is two months later, and the prosecutor will renew the visa with the prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s explanation when entering the country. On the first day of the plane, please appear on the 30th day. If you are out of the 31st day, it will be overdue, and a fine is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Mobile card **: International roaming of domestic mobile phone cards can not use Google. It is recommended to get a local mobile phone card. [Local mobile phone card] (&lt;a href=&#34;http://xhslink.com/78j8iu&#34;&gt;http://xhslink.com/78j8iu&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;local mobile phone card&amp;rdquo;), you can unlock the mobile phone card for three months in the business hall for three months, but long -term use needs to be unlocked in the IMEI customs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Cash **: Some stores support credit cards such as VISA, and most stores need local currency. In China, you can exchange Indonesian currencies in advance in the Bank of China. After entering the country, you can also use the domestic UnionPay savings to pick up money on the ATM of BCA (I have tried several banks, only BCA can be cash withdrawal), ATM will charge a small amount The fixed amount fee is also charged in proportion to your UnionPay savings card (5%of China Merchants Bank, and the Construction Bank is 12 yuan+1%). Please check according to your savings card bank. ** Please pay attention to using VISA credit cards for all currencies (RMB and USD) VISA credit cards for all currencies. **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Language **: When entering the country, the prosecutor will ask you some simple questions in English. Western tourists in Ubud have always been endless, and most merchants and taxi drivers will speak English. If English is not fluent, you can also communicate with simple gestures. Merchants will tell you the price with a calculator. The logo on the street is mainly Indonesian, which may not be marked in English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Time difference **: The Bali time zone is the same as domestic, but the Indonesian capital Jakarta takes an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Leaving the airport **: You can take a taxi at the airport to your hotel. The airport is in Gianyar, which is very close to Canggu, and it is a bit far from Ubud. The price is RMB 150 if you take a taxi to Ubud. If you do n’t hurry, you can [walk out of the airport] (&lt;a href=&#34;http://xhslink.com/2OB9iu&#34;&gt;http://xhslink.com/2OB9iu&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;walk out of the airport&amp;rdquo;), there is a fixed time to Ubud&amp;rsquo;s luxury buses at a fixed time at the airport at the airport [Tickets for buying Kura Kura Bus on KLOOK]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-local-clothing-food-housing&#34;&gt;2. Local clothing, food, housing,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many Muslim culture in Jakarta, but Bali is mainly Hindu culture. Most families will build temples in their own homes. There are worshiping god statues, and sacrifices will be replaced every day. The sacrifices of millet and small flowers are very distinctive. You need to wear trousers when you enter the temple. Pay attention to dragging off your shoes according to the instructions and entering your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;衣服&#34;&gt;衣服&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperature of the year is 20-35, which is comfortable than the summer cities in the country. It is enough to bring a few sets of summer clothes and a set of long -sleeved trousers. You can bring your own belt or buy slippers, towels, toiletries, mosquito repellent water, washing powder, because many homestays do not provide any washing products and slippers, washing machines, and hair dryers. The local laundry is very cheap, and 3 yuan can be washed a large bag of clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locals usually drag their shoes into the room (the same is true of most countries in Southeast Asia), so it is necessary to have a pair of sandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diet&#34;&gt;diet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local restaurants are called Warung. Indonesian stir -fried rice and stir -fried noodles are NASI GORENG and Mie Goreng. The English menu for tourists is provided. The local restaurant is only Indonesian, but you can order meals in gestures. Restaurant opened by foreigners usually charge additional service fees and taxes. Local restaurants only charge food costs, and they usually do not need to be tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend that I have eaten a great restaurant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Rona Warung **, on the rice fields, the scenery is good, fried rice and dessert are delicious, about 25 yuan a meal. It is recommended to walk nearby. This is the widest landscape near the rice field near the center of Wubu, which is very quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Warung Garasi and GUEST House **, rest on Sunday, is very popular with tourists at other times. It mainly provides local foods and beverages. It is very authentic and delicious local fried rice and fried noodles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Warung Pondok Madu **, roast pork steak with fried rice plus local beer is perfect. Many Chinese eat here for dinner here, about 35-60 yuan a meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siboghana Waroeng&lt;/strong&gt;，超级推荐，在本地人家的庭院里，环境好，一餐 25 元左右。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mie Kuy Ubud&lt;/strong&gt;，味道一般，但价格便宜，一餐 5 ～ 20 元。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** La Portal to Shamballah **, a vegetarian Western restaurant, the male owner is Egyptian, the hostess is Russians, you can know many friends here, there are many social activities, about 20 yuan a meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mama&amp;rsquo;s Warung&lt;/strong&gt;，口碑很好，但我一直没来吃过。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bintang Supermarket Ubud&lt;/strong&gt;，这是一家本地的大超市，像沃尔玛一样大，门口边有一家素食自助，30 元。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prima Warung Pure Vegetarian&lt;/strong&gt;，口碑很好的素食餐厅，一餐 20 元。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;住宿&#34;&gt;住宿&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;推荐 Airbnb 找民宿，可以体验很多当地人家里的 homestay。也可以用 Booking 定酒店和青旅。推荐一家口碑很好的青旅，Sila Urip Guest House，可以进他们家中的寺庙参观，还能参与制作本地食物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to pay attention to the facilities of the homestay. Many homestays do not provide any toiletries and slippers, washing machines, and hair dryers. Some are only electric fans and no air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live for a long time, you can first book a short term, and then find the owner of the homestay. You can get a very favorable price for monthly rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;出行&#34;&gt;出行&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubud does not have a bus. It is better to use Grab or cars in Ubud, which is cheaper than domestic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a local rental motorcycle service, and the price is cheap, about 30 yuan a day. You must bring a helmet, you can drive on the left, and there are a lot of motorcycles on the road. You need to pay attention to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;三其他推荐&#34;&gt;三、其他推荐&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;地点推荐&#34;&gt;地点推荐&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Eiger SHOP **, outdoor shop, finally found this shop, mountaineering shoes and other equipment. Ubud has no Decathlon and Uniqlo, and there is a well -known product on the main street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacred Ubud Spa&lt;/strong&gt;，稻田边的按摩店，非常推荐，来了巴厘岛不体验一次 Balinese Massage 很吃亏哎，只要 60 元就可以精油按摩一小时，非常棒。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Billage Bali&lt;/strong&gt;，可以参观大型的竹子结构的建筑，了解环保组织。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Batur Volcano **: I personally do not recommend popular crawling volcano watching the sunrise activities. Starting at 2 am, climbing mountain climbing, cold and increasing the difficulty of climbing. I may not see the sunrise, and I missed the scenery up the mountain. The last path is difficult, the slope is steep, and the veteran climbing must also pay attention to the path formed by the volcanic ash, but the scenery is very good during the day. The locals nearby will persuade you to pay for the guidance. There is no explicit regulation to find the guide. Climbing the volcano during the day, the path to the mountain is very easy to find. It is recommended that novice friends find the guide. For the climbing veteran, I recommend a [no guide to the guide to climb the mountain] ;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Sacred Monkey Forest **: It&amp;rsquo;s close to the main street of the main street. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss it. The green trees are overcast forest park, tall tropical trees, and many monkeys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Ceding Rice Rerrace Terrace Hiking **: The scenery is very good, and the residential houses in the nearby villages are also quiet. In the evening, I accidentally heard the musical instrument performance in the temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;软件推荐&#34;&gt;软件推荐&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Google Map **, not only the map, but also the evaluation of various stores, which are necessary for overseas. However, it should be noted that the international roaming of domestic mobile phone cards cannot use Google&amp;rsquo;s **!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Maps.me **, very useful navigation software, there are many small paths on the Google Map, which can be navigation offline and necessary for outdoor!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Grab **, a must -have taxi software for Bali, more convenient and cheap motorcycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Airbnb **, usually the price is cheaper than the hotel. You can live in the local house. A great experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Booking **, overseas booking hotels and hostels, similar to Ctrip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** KLook **, you can find the airport to Ubud&amp;rsquo;s bus, a comfortable special car of 75 yuan, which is 150 yuan cheaper than a taxi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Tripadvisor **, a bit like a public comment, you can find accommodation and restaurants with good reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** WhatsApp **, chat software used by locals and foreign tourists, similar to WeChat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Xiaohongshu **, provide very useful Bali travel information, go to Xiaohongshu to search for a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;活动信息平台&#34;&gt;活动信息平台&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Bali digital nomads ** Organized activity information: [nomeo] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nomeo.io/meetups&#34;&gt;https://nomeo.io/meetups&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;nomeo&amp;rdquo;), this is a website developed by digital nomads in Bali, the website authors live on Cang Gu. There is a wealth of information on the website, which can be screened to which city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;沙发客&lt;/strong&gt;组织的活动信息：&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.couchsurfing.com/&#34; title=&#34;couch surfing&#34;&gt;couch surfing&lt;/a&gt; ，一次性付费网站，本身是为了提供旅行换宿，但也有很多有意思的本地活动，比如 City Walk，爬火山，晚餐聚会。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;冥想和瑜伽&#34;&gt;冥想和瑜伽&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOGA BARN may be the most well -known yoga museum in Bali. It provides 200 hours of yoga teacher training. Yoga enthusiasts around the world have come here to train their own training certificates for 1 month. There are many yoga museums in Bali. Many yoga courses do not need to register. Usually a lesson does not exceed 75 yuan, and the price of long -term courses can be much lower. You can find a lot of yoga museum evaluation and curriculum website on Google Map. I recommend a few I have experienced here. You can use your name to find the address on Google Map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;** Ubud Yoga House **: Not far from the Ubud Palace, located in the rice field, the noise is quiet, the environment is superb, you can see fireflies when you do yoga in the evening, but there will be more mosquitoes.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我现在27岁。 我的第一个英语课程大约是10岁。那时英语不是在小学上教授的课程，通常从中学开始教书。 但是我母亲在星期六找到了一位老师来教我简单的英语单词。 我主要学习了基本词汇，例如数字，几个月和字母。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从7年级开始，学校开始为学生提供英语课。 英语是一门重要的课程，因为它占用了750和分数的120分。 这个分数将决定您可以去哪个高中。 您的分数越高，学校越好，那么您就会被一所顶级大学录取的机会越大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一个重大变化发生在8年级。我们的英语老师会系统地教我们英语语音学。 我对语音学的了解很好，因此我可以通过阅读语音标记来发音英语，而大多数中国学生都在使用中文拼音来帮助他们了解英语的发音。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;逐渐地，我发现我有兴趣阅读教科书或测试论文中的英语短篇小说。 他们提供有趣的故事，有时还提供有关生活的一些好技巧，这与我中文教科书中的严肃文章不同。 英语考试对我来说很容易，我甚至喜欢阅读测试中包含的文章。 我还努力地记住很多词汇，这有助于我的阅读。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二个重大变化发生在我的大学。 我决定当时改善发音。 我在互联网上找到了一些好的教程，并购买了一本教科书，教美国英语发音。 这本书的作者是台湾人，他听起来像是美国本地人。 在音频之后，我花了一个月的时间，重复他的发音以纠正我的口音。 反复练习后，我的舌头习惯了一些困难的发音，我感到口音得到了很多改善。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同时，我使用一些ESL（英语作为第二语言）音频材料来进行阴影练习。 三个月过去了，我学到了很多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在大学里有很多业余时间，我还试图阅读英语小说。 我完成了哈利·波特的前4本书。 我对英语水平充满信心，但是我没有机会与英语用语者交谈。 我的大学没有外国人，我的英语老师也是中国人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在大学结束时，我计划去研究生院学习软件编程。 我需要通过研究生入学考试。 四个考试之一是英语水平测试。 我对英语充满信心，所以我只准备了词汇。 我花了3个月的时间使用间隔重复记住1500 GRE词汇。 那时，我不知道抽认卡。 我使用了基于著名保留曲线的软件，以提醒我查看词汇书的某些页面。 最后，我获得了很高的英语考试成绩，没有任何语法准备。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24岁那年，我获得了工程硕士学位，并进入了一家大型中国国际公司。 我们的一些同事是外国人，所以我们会用英语发短信。 但是我仍然很难阅读长期的英语文章，并且对说话缺乏信心。 但是我不再花时间学习英语，忙于担任软件工程师。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的第二名雇主是东南公司。 我们的产品经理主要在新加坡办公室工作，但他们可以和我说流利的中文。 我们的所有公司文档在工作空间中都是英文的。 我的一些中国同事会使用Google翻译将它们变成中文。 但是翻译的结果并不令人满意，所以我宁愿阅读原始英语并查找陌生的单词。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在Covid之后，出国旅行康复。 我对中国的封闭媒体环境和强大的政府监督感到厌倦。 我想知道外国人的生活是什么样的。 而且我也想练习我的英语以达到流利性，并在将来为外国公司找到一份远程工作。 我想在办公室里和面具两年后被卡住，我想走到外面，向世界开放。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以我今年六月辞掉了工作。 我花了一个月的时间在菲律宾上英语课，然后去印度尼西亚的巴厘岛。 接下来，我将在马来西亚槟城度过一个月，在清迈和曼谷，泰国，泰国和老挝2周的时间。 然后，我将回到中国参加在中国的美国领事馆的签证采访，参加下一次拉丁美洲之行。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-3&#34;&gt;Part 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我在菲律宾长滩岛学习英语4周，在20年前由加拿大一所的一所国际英语学校学习。 这是我第一次出国。 英语沉浸式充满挑战，但对我有帮助。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通过与我的英语老师和同学交谈，我了解到，即使我不知道一些高级单词，我也可以使用简单的单词来传达类似的含义。 这就是所谓的以意义为中心的活动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我每天有四个课程：一个阅读课，一个语法课和两个一对一的演讲课。 我最喜欢的是伦敦一位男老师教授的阅读课。 他大约60岁，晚上将在一家餐厅弹吉他。 他热衷于对学生的教学和鼓励。 他会问我们有趣的问题，例如我们认为我们的才华。 我回答说我不知道我是否有才华。 他告诉我，每个人都在某些事情上才华横溢，我会发现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在语法课上，我了解了名词子句和被动语音。 要求学生使用课堂上教授的语法知识来做很多句子。 记住许多语法结构很无聊，但是听到来自不同国家的人的句子很有趣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从一对一的课程中，我了解了有关菲律宾的政治，教育体系和社会问题。 两位老师是菲律宾人。 其中一个喜欢阅读英语小说，并且正在写自己想出版的小说。 另一个人喜欢听他最喜欢的F-Pop歌手，并在晚上花了很多时间浏览Tiktok。 他们俩都担心菲律宾政府的现状。 他们认为腐败在菲律宾仍然是一个大问题，情况越来越严重。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除了定期课程外，学校还举办了许多其他有趣的活动，例如周二晚上的测验。 参与费用为每人50比索。 他们分为2、3甚至4组。 每个小组将共同回答一系列问题。 得分最高的小组将赢得所有比索。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-4&#34;&gt;Part 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7月底，我从语言学校毕业，对水晶蓝色海滩和友好的当地人有着美好的回忆。 我仍然在Instagram上与我的一位老师保持联系，我们就英语文学交换了意见。
然后我乘飞机飞往印度尼西亚的巴厘岛。 我住在乌布（Ubud），一个美丽的村庄，周围环绕着梯田稻田。 世界各地有很多旅行者。 这是练习英语的好机会。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在第一周，我和罗马尼亚的一个朋友一起出去玩🇷🇴使用Couchsurfing。 我们沿着黄昏的稻田走，参观了竹村，并一起上了瑜伽课。 我们星期六徒步旅行了山地batur。 我们从上午10点开始徒步旅行，以避免参加日出的拥挤的游客。 跋涉过后，我们在当地的一家餐厅吃午餐。 我喜欢Balinese本地餐厅，该餐厅在印度尼西亚人中被称为Warung，因为它很便宜（炒米饭3美元，蔬菜和阳光明媚的鸡蛋，而0.80美元用于一勺冰淇淋），并提供了良好的周围风景。 午餐后，我们花了一个小时在温泉游泳池里玩。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在第二周，我睡在旅馆的一个6个老板房间里。 因此，我遇到了来自印度，澳大利亚，法国，土耳其，美国，荷兰等的游客。但是，我逐渐厌倦了结识新朋友并进行闲聊。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在第三周，我去了乡村别墅。 它很安静，靠近稻田。 我整天在房间里学习英语，并沿着黄昏的稻田散步。 我在手机上读了英语小说，并在Netflix上观看了没有字幕的电视节目。 我加入了语言学习subreddit，并学习了更多有关学习的理论。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在，我正在练习我学到的语言学习理论。 我想从B2到C1获得英语。 我想像母语者一样自由使用英语，以便我可以更多地了解我们的世界。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; The End &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At less than 6:30 on Sunday, I woke up from the bed, picked up the mobile phone on the table, checked the matters to be handled today, and waited for the alarm clock at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At less than 7:30, I was already sitting on the bench of the restaurant, carrying a schoolbag, there were scholarship for breakfast, half a bottle of hot boiling water, and a Chinese novel borrowed to me by Taiwan classmates. Finally, Teacher Zelle came in. &amp;ldquo;Wait a while, I drink a cup of coffee.&amp;rdquo; Saying her tearing the coffee powder bag, bent over to push the water coffee in front of the water dispenser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain was crackling outside. Recently, there seems to be a typhoon passing. This week&amp;rsquo;s rain is intermittent. After a while, the slippers under the eaves are poured down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelle and I walked out of the courtyard and stopped the car on the road at the door. &amp;ldquo;The storms are very large in the past few days. The tourist pier on this road has been suspended, so it is difficult to wait until the passenger three -wheel wheels. We can only take a motorcycle.&amp;rdquo; The passenger tricycle is usually 3 yuan per person. The car costs 13 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelle and motorcycle driver said a few words in dialects, and then we got on the car. I was sandwiched in the middle, and Zelle sat behind me. I supported the umbrella and barely covered our hair and upper body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After riding for 5 or 6 minutes, the rain was getting bigger and bigger, and we stopped on the road to hide from the rain. At this time, we have reached a more lively position on the island. We paid half of the motorcycle money and took the tricycle with compartment. The tricycle drove for another 7 or 8 minutes, passed by the center area, and moved forward for a short section. Zelle stopped the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our destination is here, just 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock. Teacher Zelle took me to a Christian church to worship. Teacher Zelle at the restaurant last night said that she would worship the day. I just passed a church by the beach at night, so I asked her if she was the one. Churchian, invites me to come together tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we walked into the church, a middle -aged man with a white clothes was thinking on the small table on the right of the podium. &amp;ldquo;Is he talking about English?&amp;rdquo; After listening for a while, I asked Zelle. &amp;ldquo;No, he is talking about the Philippines mixed with English.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sitting on a row of benches in the middle of the podium. Each row of benches will reach back a small platform backwards to put down our arms. When the person behind is kneeling, we can hold this small platform in the front seat. There is a long leather kneeling pad on the ground in front of the bench, which has a mottled cracks on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain time, a team of young people came in in the door of the church. &amp;ldquo;They are Altar Boy, and they will assist the pastor to complete the ceremony.&amp;rdquo; Zelle said to my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A green robe pastor did not know where to step on the podium, sitting on the high -back chair in the middle, and a Altar Boy adjust the position of the electric fan facing him. Another young man with a white clothes walked to the desk on the left side of the podium, rolled the Bible, and selected paragraphs to share with everyone. The two monitors on the wall lit up at the same time, reminding the English prayer, and everyone recited them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sacrament was sent, several men in white came with a plate, and Christians in the crowd ranked several columns to receive a small piece of bread to eat. The plate of the sacred meal finally recovered in front of the Rev. Green Clothes, and the pastor poured the bread crumbs in each plate into a bronze cup and drank it with water. The men in white took the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman wearing white clothes in the middle, holding a long rod, and white cloth pocket at the top of the long rod. When they passed a long chair, they flattened the long rod and sent the cloth to us. &amp;ldquo;This is used for collecting donations, you can freely.&amp;rdquo; I followed Zelle and put the change in the wallet. When the woman sent the cloth to us for the second time, I was a little wondering. Zelle and I said, &amp;ldquo;The first time is to help the poor and do donations of good deeds. The second time is to donate to the church&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray. Rev. Green Clothes walked down the podium, a group of people surrounded him, and a bottle in his hand shaking his hand and throwing water drops out. &amp;ldquo;This is Shengshui, we can get blessings.&amp;rdquo; So we also stepped forward to accept the blessings of the Holy Water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelle pointed to the position of the second floor. The sound of music in the church was not the music, but the singing class on the second floor sang in real time. I realized that when I prayed in the middle, I turned my head and looked up. Sure enough, I saw 4 or 5 young people on the second floor. There was another person in front of them seemed to be instructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we walked out of the church, the rain had stopped. The air in the early morning was cool and refreshing. Zelle took a tricycle back to school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/philippines/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 30, 2023, Shenzhen, China, in the afternoon of Friday, looked back at a small 10 -square -meter room that had lived for 4 years. There are also movie posters bought by Taobao, and the desktop has been cleaned up. Seeing that it resumed the empty appearance, I felt a little panicked. This small room that had lived for 4 years has no longer belonging to me. In this city, country, and even the planet, I will start a section of a certain place where there is no place. The journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pot of green dill was bought in the summer of 2020. It was when I first left, and I picked it on the night market street. Since then, it has lived with me for almost 3 years. When I pulled it out of the basin, it brought out the whole pot of soil together. It studied everywhere in the cramped small flower pot. There were several laps on the outer side of the soil. Drilling the water pores and looking for soil out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled it out of the flower pot, with the soil in the basin, and threw it to the high place, it fell into the grass on the soil slope. You are free, I say it to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 hours later, the plane arrived at Manila, the capital of the Philippines. I waited for the next journey to the airplane of Catkland at the terminal. I will report to the Language School tomorrow and start English for 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After experiencing a series of transportation -taxi, the speedboat from Shenzhen to Hong Kong airport, the airport transfer rail transit, the medium -sized passenger aircraft from Hong Kong to Manila, the airport transfer buses, the small aircraft from Manila to Catkland, to the small on the dock The tricycle, the ferry to Boracay, a large tricycle, at 9 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the evening on July 1, finally arrived at a youth hostel on the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, go to the business hall of the island center to apply for a Philippine mobile phone card, and then use offline map navigation to the language school to report. A staff member heard the door bell and told me that no one in the school on Sunday was brought to the dormitory area across the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a red flower blooming at the door of the dormitory, opening the white iron door, which is like a garden. There are many mango trees and other green plants. Two ladies and two children enthusiastically greeted me through the open living room. They were Taiwanese families who came to school one week in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently two types of courses in language schools. One is for children&amp;rsquo;s summer camps (unique to summer vacation). There are language learning and outdoor activities throughout the day, including three meals and accommodation; the other is English training for adults. Choose different lessons for learning goals and freely match accommodation and ordering according to needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My course is the second type, 4 days every five days, 4 lessons every day, 50 minutes each lesson, a grammar group lesson, one reading group lesson, and two -to -one special spoken communication. Take 3 lessons in the morning, take lunch in the school, take 1 lesson in the afternoon, and you can arrange freely after 2 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the Taiwanese families who come to the summer camp are all from the Taiwanese families. The students participating in adult courses are from different countries and regions, such as Japan, Switzerland, Spain, and Russia. Like me, there is only one Zhejiang girl who comes with her father. She takes 3 lessons and goes to the golf training after lunch every day. Her skin is very sunny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boracay is a well -known tourist attraction in the Philippines. The narrow island that moves north and south makes you can see unobstructed sea sunset on the soft and blue beaches of the west coast. This is also one of the safest and highest prices in the Philippines. A bowl of dolphin ramen in a Japanese restaurant that can see the sunset on the beach requires 45 yuan, but if you avoid the beach, you are willing to go to the local restaurants on the street to eat You can eat a rich dinner of one meal, two bowls of rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beautiful sea views and friendly islanders have attracted many foreign tourists. The principal of my language school is a Canadian who was attracted. He founded this language school in 2005 and has lived here for 15 years. When I asked the teacher in the reading class, Steve, why he chose to stay in Boracay instead of other countries in Southeast Asia, he said it was because of friendly people here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English is the second official language of the Philippines. Children start English from the last semester of the first grade of elementary school, and most of the courses of higher education use English professors. According to the impression of the Philippine teachers, most people&amp;rsquo;s language familiarity is the local dialect, English, and finally the Philippines. Most Filipino adults can use simple English to communicate. The Philippines is the country with the highest popularity in English in Asian countries, and the accent of English is closest to standard pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two -to -one courses are Philippines, one of which is an English teacher in a public elementary school. He comes here to teach English part -time in the summer vacation. Usually he will prepare a short article, let me read it aloud, and then this is this. The topic of the article asked my views, such as &amp;ldquo;what kind of lifestyle pursuing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;whether to eat breakfast&amp;rdquo;; another teacher is similar to me and will talk to me about many daily lives of the Philippines, such as school education system, the Philippines, the Philippines Legal policies for divorce and abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher of the grammar class is giving us 5 students in terms of terms. We need to take turns to complete the practice of sentences in the classroom. These learning contents are actually included in the English courses of high school students in mainland China, so it is more like reviewing for me. And application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like reading lessons. The article selected by Steve is very interesting. For example, &amp;ldquo;Paradise Lost&amp;rdquo; discusses the impact of travel on the locals, and &amp;ldquo;Conspiracy on the Death of the Princess Diana&amp;rdquo; tells the rumors of Princess Diana&amp;rsquo;s death. The five students in the classroom come from 5 different countries and regions, so you can hear the story of everyone&amp;rsquo;s own country. Steve is also a teacher who can perform a very physical performance (he is a guitarist). He can perform various emotions with vivid performances, such as how to pretend to be a stomachache to escape from a surging dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes me feel particularly interesting in the small class group lesson is that unlike in the large class, there are usually only individual students who have the opportunity to speak. Here, every classmate will take turns to speak. There is a feeling that each individual is respected. And everyone must learn to listen to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have a word that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, I will be proposed immediately. For example, the word &amp;ldquo;travel bug&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what it means in class, the teacher will ask other students to help explain it, and will give it an example, and let us 5 students answer BUG &amp;ldquo;, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this way of learning is not as efficient as a problem, but I like it very much. I think it will allow you to enjoy the happiness of using English communication better, and in the process, you will unknowingly learn to learn English words by using other understandable alternative explanations, not to study dictionary. Now I prefer to check words instead of the European dictionary, because ChatGPT is like a classmate in the course, it will explain and give examples in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And coming to an island that almost everyone can speak English to learn English, it is like entering a comprehensive English corner. Whether you participate in the encyclopedia knowledge at the bar, watch the sunset on the cruise, eat barbecue in a Korean restaurant, or take a walk home after dinner, you can come to an English exchange anytime, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are no shortage of anxiety in digital nomad life. Lin An said, &amp;ldquo;Doing a freelance career, anxiety is your good friend. The best way to relieve anxiety is to do things. Do not be in trouble when you are anxious.&amp;rdquo; Xixi is easy to be easy Anxious digital nomad, &amp;ldquo;Editing for a while without contacting me, I started to panic, wondering if she was left out.&amp;rdquo; I was afraid that the editor would forget her or be replaced by other authors. However, she can retreat after she has a house. In Beijing, there is a house in Beijing. If you ca n’t do free career, you can collect rent. At the end of the story of Xixi, Lin An reminded those who want to not go to work, the destiny has set the scope of our fate, and we must respect the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin An was worried that young people would only see the beautiful side of the freelance, naked without preparing, and finally made their situation bad. When she resigned in 2018, she prepared a deposit that could not starve to death in Shanghai for two years without income, and formulated the first three months to realize the balance of revenue and expenditure. Essence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps, when there is no direction in my heart, it is also a choice with 20,000 yuan to explore yourself and the world bravely like a ball. As Alison said, &amp;ldquo;No matter which step to the end of the road, there will always be a way.&amp;rdquo; The external environment will subtly affect the status and goals of people. When I was together, I found that wealthy friends were also anxious, but even her own anxiety of the future became more. &amp;ldquo;But when I left that environment and was with digital tourists, this group of people gave each other confidence and encouragement to each other, and made me feel that what I was doing can be recognized and more confident and calm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you do a good job of re -action, or take action first, and constantly adjust your goals in action? This is not a question of who is wrong, nor is it black or white, but the degree of personality tendency. The fourth latitude in the MBTI personality tendency test is to distinguish your way of working? Are you judging tendencies or a person who is aware of? Those who awareness Pure P pay attention to flexibility and adaptability, seek more new ideas and real experiences, and are willing to explore a new travel destination with unknown unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this journey of life, there is no standard answer. As mentioned in the ball, &amp;ldquo;life is not track, but the wilderness.&amp;rdquo; May you play happily in your wilderness and live well, and live up to this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although after growing up, the car has become a commonplace, but I still miss the window that will move. I think that I also install a window that can move myself in the future. Wilderness, not track.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why did I sell my virtual reality glasses</title>
      <link>https://haroldgao.com/post/vrglass/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>xiangaoole@gmail.com (Harold Gao)</author>
      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/vrglass/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At more than 2 am (Beijing time) on June 6, 2023, at the Apple Developer Conference, after the introduction of the new features of iOS, iPados, and MacOS in one hour, the lens turned to a dark lecture hall, a silver -haired Apple company chief of Apple Company Executive Cook, with his slightly old voice, said, &amp;ldquo;There is another product, we have prepared for it for many years.&amp;rdquo; The big screen is dark, and the bright arc outlines a outline of a ski mirror. This is Apple&amp;rsquo;s first virtual reality glasses, Apple Vision Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have bought Facebook&amp;rsquo;s virtual reality head wearing glasses Oculus Quest2 (Facebook is renamed Meta Quest2). It was the most cost -effective integrated virtual reality glasses at that time. You can experience the 2K physical display screen brought by more than 2,000 yuan. Virtual reality effect. A few months later, I sold it on the idle fish. This short essay is to review Apple&amp;rsquo;s virtual reality glasses from the place where I am dissatisfied with QUEST2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct reason for me to give up is to be unfriendly to the people of the glasses. I have 400 degrees myopia. Although QUEST 2 supports magnetic myopia lenses, I also spend more than 100 yuan from Taobao to customize the lens, but the actual effect of the lens is not good. Just like our ordinary myopia lenses, the curvature perspective in front of us is very good, but if you look at the viewing angle of the side of the lens obliquely, you will easily see the blurredness caused by the unevenness of the curvature. VR glasses fix the perspective of the glasses, and the space on the side will have this unnatural vagueness. Of course, this can be alleviated. One is customized lenses (rising costs), and the other is wearing contact lenses. Compared with the high price of Apple VR glasses (more than 20,000 yuan before tax), the cost of these two measures is relatively relative It&amp;rsquo;s not high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness. Wearing Quest 2 glasses is like being immersed in a world that others can&amp;rsquo;t see. It will have a feeling of isolation in the world, and when you wear VR glasses, it is usually in a safe and unmanned place. For example, on the chair and living room sofa in the bedroom, this feeling of isolation from the world has been increased. Apple develops some social functions based on the iOS ecosystem, and you can look forward to the social application of VR eyes; on the other hand, he is curious if anyone will bring glasses to appear in daily scenes. Even if the eyesight effect can allow you and the people around you Eye communication, but because some of your attention is in another online world, it will definitely affect the feeling of external people when communicating with you, just like communicating with people wearing Bluetooth headsets often feel that he can’t hear you speak. Essence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumbersome and top. Quest 2 integrates the battery in the head display, which makes it even more bulky to wear on the head. Apple&amp;rsquo;s head is connected to a battery with a charging cable. You can use the battery in your pocket to reduce the weight of the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullen. Just like a mobile phone, the VR screen is used for a long time, and the eye part is closed because it is closed, so it is easy to cover the eye area. Watching the video of the Apple conference, there is a row of heat dissolutions in front of the head, and it is also equipped with the M2 chip optimized by Apple&amp;rsquo;s home heat. According to my MacBook Pro experience, the chip&amp;rsquo;s cooling ability will be much better than Quest2, but considering the screen resolution of screen resolution From 2K to 4K, the heat dissipation effect still needs to see the actual situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low playability and not rich in applications. Quest2 VR game is to play with the body, it is quite hard; watching the movie is good, but there are problems mentioned earlier and hot; when browsing the web, although it was a very good 720P naked eye resolution (2K physical screen) at that time (2K physical screen) The effect is still average, and the large -screen webpage based on Android is inconvenient to use two handles. Apple has launched a new operating system for virtual reality glasses. In the future, there will be a richer software ecosystem that optimizes it, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it. Baseball; you can use your two -handed finger to use the virtual keyboard across the air. The effect of daily office can also look forward to it (just, it is a bit doubtful, can it really be realized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Quest2 allowed me to experience the immersion effect of virtual reality. It was amazing for the first time, but it really couldn&amp;rsquo;t compare with the world that I saw. It was easy to attract me to play at the same time. Eating gray and taking off the glasses, the world in front of me suddenly returned from 720P to the retina, which is easier and colorful, and it cannot replace the happiness of linking with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the good impression of Apple&amp;rsquo;s product interaction experience, I look forward to the ultimate effect of Apple VR glasses, and I am also curious about through Apple&amp;rsquo;s help. Virtual reality glasses will eventually make humans link and communicate with each other more conveniently. People are more isolated and self -centered? let us wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vivi: After working for three years, I went to Carnegie Mellon to restart my life</title>
      <link>https://haroldgao.com/post/vivi/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>xiangaoole@gmail.com (Harold Gao)</author>
      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/vivi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Editor&amp;rsquo;s click: vivi is my classmate in the character interview class. Seeing her self -introduction, I was attracted to it all at once, and then learned more about her stories about her through Xiaohongshu. Finally, at 11 am in Beijing time, at 8 pm in San Francisco time, crossing half of the earth, we started this online interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 is the fourth year of Vivi working in the United States. Now she is a product designer in Microsoft. Her Cloudai team is connected to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new generation of artificial intelligence products to the project of the cloud service platform Azure. The era of a national AI has come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, in 2017, Trump became the 45th president of the United States. Chinese Goist Ke Jie defeated the artificial intelligence AlphaGo against artificial intelligence, and shared bicycles swept the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, she was a product manager of a domestic e -commerce platform. One night in summer, worked overtime on the way home late, and she was determined to resign naked. Two weeks later, she left the company. After more than half a year of preparing for the exam, she got the graduate offer of the human -computer interaction of Carnegie Mellon University. She graduated from Silicon Valley to work in Silicon Valley. Sister &amp;ldquo;account name sharing her record of self -exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the three years of domestic work, Vivi has also been wrapped in the wolf culture of the Internet, and her overtime, internal consumption and even workplace harassment have caused her to be almost depressed. Until one day, she asked herself, &amp;ldquo;If I work hard and lucky enough on this road, can I become what I want to be? Can I live a life I want to live?&amp;rdquo; She heard the answer in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I originally wanted to work while working, while working, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be gap for a year. I was worried that I wasted this year. What would I do? Others are progressing and promoting. I did not make money again this year. But later, because the work pressure and learning pressure were very great, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything if I wanted to do everything. When I walked home from the company in the middle of the night, I suddenly felt that I was put down. Just resign now, my savings are enough for me to use it in this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Originally thought of resigning in January the next year, because a stock would not be fulfilled at that time. I thought about it at that time, ** Is this stock important or my future? More importantly, I must go abroad. I must read this graduate student, so don&amp;rsquo;t have this stock. After you give up one thing, you will be accustomed to giving up. ** &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;我有创作的欲望&#34;&gt;我有创作的欲望&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivi University of Foreign Economic and Trade, who studied undergraduate from Beijing, has been transferred from &amp;ldquo;Chinese&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Spanish&amp;rdquo;. After graduation, she did not choose a professional related work. Management Trainee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have the desire to create. When I learn language most, I still interpret others. At that time, I felt that the space for creativity was not very large. It was just a skill. I also wanted to know something outside of the language. Guan Peisheng of this company can go to different positions in different positions. I want to understand what is the same industry, so I chose that job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At that time, the jobs in the rotation were advertising, product managers, mining and sales (procurement and sales), and even went to the warehouse to do some logistics things. The entire e -commerce process had basically passed in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The rotation lasted for more than half a year. Finally, I made a product manager, until I left the company. When I was doing the product manager, I found that I didn’t really like the work that communicated and coordinated, but I found that I enjoyed the drawing flowchart. During the wire frame diagram. I like to do my own stalls instead of updating project information for different people, so I later transferred UX (user experience design). &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;我要出国工作&#34;&gt;我要出国工作&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After naked resignation, Vivi prepared a school for human -computer interaction for the United States for more than half a year. Her little red book shared her process of applying for school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-July to August: Test GR
-Un September to October: TOEFL TOEFL, start making works
-N November: Two main items of the collection of work collections
-December: Write a document and finish the last two small projects of the work collection
-1 January: Submit an application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have always had the desire to study abroad. After work, I deposited some money and finally had an economic foundation. Another reason was that I worked in China for 3 years and I was afraid of the first job. I must never stay here again. I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want to live such a life anymore, it is a bit like running. For the time being, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to work in China (at the time), so I chose to go abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now (in the United States) work rhythm is basically stable, from nine to five, or even on Friday, it is No Meeting Day. You will not arrange a meeting. You can do your own things. It may only work for half a day. I took 3 days and it was a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After the epidemic, the working hours are relatively free. As long as you can complete your work, you can participate in the online meeting on time. No one cares about you when you get off work or work. I am working at home now. Although the company also has an office, the station is not fixed, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go. Most of the time you want where you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the first half of the long -range work, the first half of the long -range work was very uncomfortable. The first point was the problem of living space. At that time, the house leased with others at that time, one room, one room, the bedroom and the office were in the same room. In this room, it will affect emotions after a long time. The second point is that I have been working remotely before I came to the United States for a long time. At that time, no friends were here, and I did n’t know anyone. In fact, the fastest understanding of the work at the beginning The way of a new person is in the office. After this way, he found that loneliness is coming, and he is alone at home every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After adapting for a long time, I slowly found a more free way. Now I am used to chatting with others on the Internet, and then a way to know people below. Now that my bedroom and office are separated, I bought some very expensive equipment, such as desks and office chairs. After you make it very comfortable, you do have improved office efficiency at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Online office software uses Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Teams work group. Maybe the reason for my work is not very fast, and there will be no emergency Deadline that you must go online before you have to go online without this anxiety. So if others are not in time, I feel that I will wait for two days. After work, I turn off the Teams. No one can find me. Even if they send me a message at night relation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;studying-in-the-united-states-is-too-bitter&#34;&gt;Studying in the United States is too bitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer school at the University of Carnegie Mellon is the dream of many people. What is the difference between Vivi studying here for a year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I even think that I didn&amp;rsquo;t call for learning before. Here I would subvert my awareness and way of learning. Of course, it may also be why I transferred from liberal arts to a discipline of liberal arts and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Study in the United States is too hard. Basically, in the first half of the year, I basically did not sleep for 5 hours a day. I kept having homework and lessons. I always had something to do, but I enjoyed it. You can really feel I have made great progress every day. I am creating new things every day. I feel very excited to learn with such cutting -edge professors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Domestic learning may also be bitter, but the learning process is relatively boring. Although I am still interested in language and literature, the teaching method has not allowed you to enjoy it very much. The bitterness of learning in the United States is pure physical strength. Hard work, not tired. I have hard work because the progress of the curriculum is a bit too fast. My own foundation is not very good. I feel God, I am so tired every day, but in fact, I feel satisfied every day. quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Teachers in class never tell you systematically, how to learn first, how to learn, and then apply it. He just tells you what you want to create one by yourself, and then how to learn you Go to learn by yourself. The teacher will tell you about the cutting -edge technology and the cutting -edge of academic academic use. He may not teach you what is very practical. As for how to learn practical skills, you want to find it yourself. Essence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The most difficult to master is actually the way of thinking and ideas. You need to do some projects in the school and pass the guidance of the teacher, and then you slowly become your own things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a concept called Project Based Learning, the project system. For example, I learned some methodology of design thinking. The assignments left you in the teacher&amp;rsquo;s class are you to apply this methodology to make a product. You have to first come first. Write a outline, what product wants to design, what problems it will solve, and how to apply it to the theory that I just learned, the teacher will help you to see the outline and give you some opinions. Finally The same theory, but everyone does something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This process has exercised your innovation ability. I encountered problems in the process in the middle. Ask my classmates and ask the teacher that the teacher may have some resources to recommend it to you, but he will not teach you step by step. I have never learned the code before. At that time, there was a course for you to write a webpage, but writing a webpage is not the point. The point is that you have to apply to a teaching theory on this webpage. In order to do this homework, I have to do this homework. To design this webpage with this theory, it is necessary to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;我不能接受在墨西哥长期工作&#34;&gt;我不能接受在墨西哥长期工作&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico is a place where many South American backpackers love. Nomad List ranks among the top ten in the whole year. Pixar&amp;rsquo;s animated film &amp;ldquo;Finding Dreams&amp;rdquo; is even more widely known. Vivi studied Spanish undergraduate, exchanged for a year in Mexico, and returned to Mexico for a month before the previous year. What would her impression of Mexico?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have lived in Mexico for a year. I feel that I am only suitable for traveling in this place, or a brief experience. If I work in this place for a long time, I may not be able to accept it. Another reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After half a year in Mexico, sometimes I feel disconnected from the world, and I feel that I will become&amp;rdquo; stupid &amp;lsquo;after a long time -the keenness of things, and what you want to get in. The efficiency is particularly low, you will find that the Chinese people are too efficient. In Mexico, you go to deal with many places. When they are not abide by, the efficiency is very low. After a long time, because you are all around you, you have such an environment. Instead of time, it will become alien, and you will do whatever you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I came into contact with the Dead Festival, I felt very fun, and there were flowers everywhere. For the first time, I found that someone had passed the&amp;rdquo; Qingming Festival &amp;ldquo;for the first time. Some people in the world viewed death like this. It is very fun to see what is very heavy. Death can be very fun. The Latin people are still very interesting. They are all optimistic. We learned a book of Mexican writer Pas who won the Nobel Prize in Literature at that time called &amp;ldquo;Lonely Lonely &amp;ldquo;Mystery&amp;rdquo;, the book mainly talks about the nationality of the Latin America. Why did their past history have caused their national character? At that time, I saw this book, which was so interesting. What you saw in life in life was It can be associated with what I learned. This process is quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When the university exchange is exchanged, traveling in South America is a bit like punching. I am worried that I will miss a thing. What should I do next time I can&amp;rsquo;t touch it. I want to do the most in a limited time. I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep on the way, and I will take a night bus now. I actually pay more attention to my current feelings. Because you find the places you go to, go to one more project and go to one project, in fact, you will still forget. I think this is more important. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I used to play with my classmates before, and I would contact new friends, but they were all people like me. We are all international students. This time, my friend brought some colleagues to Mexico. Some of them were in Mexico. Doing engineering and doing business are not the same as those who are in the same person when I go to school. When I meet a new person during the trip, chat with them. of.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-go-to-europe-to-study-anthropology-in-the-future&#34;&gt;to go to Europe to study anthropology in the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I still prefer to change, and even say that it is transformed. I like to re -understand a field every few years, and always iterate as a product. To say the ideal life, I want to create new things all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The work itself cannot fully meet my desire to create. Don&amp;rsquo;t be too high in work requirements. You can use amateur time to explore some other things.
&amp;ldquo;It took 5 years to become a freelancer, leaving the climbing ladder workplace, trying more things, and establishing a connection with the same frequency. There is a keenness to the cutting -edge things. If I am really a freelancer, I may not have this acuity, so this is temporarily doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like a rhythmic life. I work for a few years and rest for a while, focusing on absorbing knowledge, and working again. Whether it is undergraduate or graduate, either there is pressure from employment or economic pressure. There are all kinds of things that trouble you, so you can&amp;rsquo;t immerse them completely in knowledge and academics. I hope that if you have a chance in the future, you can simply enjoy knowledge, not to get what you get through it. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-suggestions-in-the-direction-of-life&#34;&gt;Some suggestions in the direction of life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looking back at the past, the biggest choice to influence me is naked resignation this time. At that time, the work was not smooth, and the family and emotional changes were also changed. In this case, it was decided to abandon a lot. Stress. After this incident, I have improved the ability of stress and the ability to face frustration. There is also a conceptual change. Tags, you can go further after putting down these things. ** &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you provide them with some reference suggestions for friends who want to make a choice of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The first suggestion is not to be too high for yourself, don&amp;rsquo;t compare with others. If you compare with others and find that others are not confused, why is he so directed? You may feel very anxious and inferior. You must not be affected by these external standards, find your own rhythm, know what you want, there is no way to compare between people. No, it is better to go to act quickly and prove that you can really **.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The second suggestion is that when you are confused, go more to see the outside world, chat with people more, try more new things, you will find that the door of the world may open more for you After trying the same thing, if it still does not work, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because it is still so young, then you can try something else. Let you enjoy this process better. ** If you are temporarily confused about life and you can&amp;rsquo;t find the direction of progress, then boldly try and error, what is more exciting than adventure. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you are confident enough and strong enough, you can abduct the&amp;rdquo; Excellent &amp;ldquo;standards that are not defined by the environment and achieve freedom of physical and mental freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yangshuo Travel Diary</title>

      <author>xiangaoole@gmail.com (Harold Gao)</author>
      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/yangshuo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The earliest wanted to go to Yangshuo was to see a Chinese article &amp;ldquo;Lonely Planet&amp;rdquo; in the Youth Hostel of Shaxi Ancient Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the May Day holiday in 2022, I finally went to Yangshuo. Many of the schedules were temporarily arranged, but the people and the people and actually made a wonderful holiday life beyond their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of each day is great, so the first half is directly shared this wonderful journey with daily records. The second half will summarize some small experiences for readers who want to travel to Yangshuo and hope to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1-betty-家晚餐&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1 Betty 家晚餐&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the Yangshuo High -speed Railway Station, there were still light rain, which was a bit cold in spring. Friends from Guangdong opened the suitcase and took out their jackets and put them on. Take the high -speed rail station bus (） 20) and reach Yangshuo Fengming Tourism Distribution Center for more than an hour. Get off your luggage and get out of the car and take another 20 minutes to reach the old county and villages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get off the bus, surrounded by the green mountains, the ducks in the farmland are playing, the big goose growls, the peasants are talking far away, drizzle, moisturizing the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few steps to drag the suitcase, Betty&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Old House&amp;rdquo; homestay is hidden in this ancient residence of the countryside without any disagreement. The &amp;ldquo;old house&amp;rdquo; house is like grandma&amp;rsquo;s grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house in memory, old wooden doors, tall tile tops, brick walls, a bit humid and cold. Betty poured me a cup of flower tea, and we sat down in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two friends in Betty in the evening, and we have dinner together. Dinner is divided into meals, a plate of main dishes, a bowl of fresh shrimp pumpkin stewed chicken soup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, I played the &amp;ldquo;speed and passion&amp;rdquo; of the poker card, drinking the self -brewed green plum wine, and when I talked about late at night, I went back to bed first, and Betty had to wait for the next stay in the next night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-2-baisha-ganji--crayfish-party&#34;&gt;Day 2 Baisha Ganji &amp;amp; crayfish party&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rushing day of Baisha Town is 1/4/7 at the end of each month. This day is 5.1, and I just caught up. In fact, the rush of the villagers nearby brings their own agricultural products to the market to buy and sell on the market. Because they usually live far, they can only gather together to form a lively market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown sugar is very delicious, fragrant and delicious, a bit like the taste of fried pumpkin cakes. Camellia is Gongcheng&amp;rsquo;s specialty. Ginger, spices and tea are boiled together, filter off the residue, put it in the opening of the kettle. When the guest comes, grab a small fried ball into the bowl, then pour the camellia from the kettle, scoop A little salt, it is fragrant, hot and bitter, but the aftertaste is rich and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty bought pumpkin seedlings in the market and went back to the backyard to take off. In order to prevent the nearby chicken from damaging, a simple cover was set up around the melon seedlings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two entrances in the backyard, and the first is a green brick flat ground that can be grilled, with a hammock. Passing through a small door, walking on the mountain a few steps is the second entrance, surrounding a small vegetable field with stones, planting peppers, pumpkin &amp;hellip; The second enters are a row of bamboo, and there are several bamboo shoots on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eat crayfish at dinner, and go to my friend Ding Ding&amp;rsquo;s house to help handle crayfish in the afternoon. The Ding Ding family also opened a homestay, and the location was remote. At the foot of the mountain, the backyard passed on to the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained in the afternoon. I took an umbrella and walked along the mountain. I saw a lot of special homestays all the way, including the &amp;ldquo;Rose Garden&amp;rdquo; homestay mentioned in the Guilin chapter of &amp;ldquo;Lonely Planet&amp;rdquo;. Go to the vegetable field and enter a staircase paved along the small road. It was surprising that Xiaoyu hit the rustling on the umbrella, and the birds screamed in the forest. Along the stone steps, the trees on both sides are dense, and the branches pass through the waterproof jacket, but I still wet my pants. This mountain road has been connected to the connection between the two mountains. It seems that there is a road forward. I decided to visit the next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking in the fields in a direction, surrounded by Karst landform specialty mountains, the chickens and dogs of the farmhouse, the sound of flowing water, and the thin rain silk, here is like a paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectations of the expectation began. The aroma of crayfish was fragrant, with cold cucumbers, boiled peanut rice, and a delicious Liquan beer. After a table, people eat 2 big cookers, and get up to 2 large pots, and eat half of them. Cook with the noodles together. The noodles are soaked with fresh shrimp flavor, which is very delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second half of dinner, Betty&amp;rsquo;s husband, Devin, came back from the field and joined us, but he only ate vegetarian and eat the garlic fried celery and fried potatoes prepared for him. When the weather was cold, the Ding Ding family prepared a bonfire, and the guests gradually surrounded the bonfire. Devin played the guitar (he was the musician of the Demo bar), and Betty sang a song (professional singer), listening to it! Then the guitarist was replaced by Ding Ding&amp;rsquo;s husband, and the guests began to sing. The bonfire was very strong, and it was warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3-攀岩徒步&#34;&gt;Day 3 攀岩&amp;amp;徒步&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eating a large bowl of pot of rice noodles in the morning, go to the Baiyan Rock Farm and try climbing. There is already a ready -made hanging point on the rock wall. The coaches climbed up along the hanging point, hung the fulcrum at the highest place, and hung the rope. The fulcrum is a sliding rail structure. One end of the rope is buckled on the climber&amp;rsquo;s waist, and the other end is buckled on the protector&amp;rsquo;s waist. As the climbers go up, the protector will close the rope to ensure that the climbers will not fall even if they lose their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip of the rock climbing shoe step on the gap in the rock wall, focus on the legs, and support the waist upwards. But I was nervous, and my arms were sore quickly. Everyone is very powerful, especially girls are very smart. Unlike boys, girls will use more flexible postures. One girl climbed all 5 lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was fine that day, and the little partner was about to prepare the mountain road discovered by the walk yesterday in the afternoon. There are many branches along the stone steps, but there are obvious people walking through this road. There are loquat trees on the side of the road. On the other side of the hillside, the stone steps are replaced by stone, surrounded by orange gardens, and the flavor of farm fat can be smelled in the air. Then the road is spacious, and the traces of farm tools appear. This is a large orchard, including oranges, oranges, mulberries, and then down the vegetable field. The little partner teaches me to identify what kind of species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon entering the quiet village, a elder sister washed carrots in the pond, and gave us the two carrots that had just been taken off. Wash the soil with pond water, and clicked up. Along the road is the cement road of the countryside. This is Baishabao Village. Going along the cement road, there is another orange garden. After asking the villagers, we decided to turn over the mountain in front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villagers are spraying pesticides, and the air has a uncomfortable pesticide taste. We walked through the dense shrubbage, finally found the road down the mountain, returned to the village along the orchard, and returned to the stone steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the &amp;ldquo;Old House&amp;rdquo; and communicated with Betty, we knew that we were walking here on a hiking route. It was really lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-4-魔鬼洞&#34;&gt;Day 4 魔鬼洞&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the rock climbing experiencers yesterday morning participated in today&amp;rsquo;s technical cave with me. Leader Jerry drove us to Xingping. There was also a Polish climbing Jianjian Oula. Her Chinese was very good to introduce the interesting knowledge of healthy vegetarian food and mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing a belt, wearing a helmet, and a detection light. After obtaining the permission of the owner of the cave, we went up the mountain to enter the cave. The caves of the scenic area are shined with colorful lights. In fact, the cave is white and gray. After oxidation, it will be gray and black. The clean column has milky white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ’s okay to climb up, and it’ s much better than the rock wall. It is always a bit embarrassed when you fall, and often hit the stone wall. The final exit is cool, just like the cave exit in the Xbox game halo series, but this climbing is very challenging to me. Finally, it is difficult to get in a difficult place. The rope went out. The exit is in the middle of the mountain, and it is also an orange garden. The sun is very good. The mountains are surrounded by the mountains. Someone is playing gliding umbrellas and hot air balloons in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cave was stunned, and there was climbing. He was exhausted and fell asleep. The video of the cave Jerry was released to [Xiaohongshu] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/627300000002103b47b?secondshare=weixin&amp;amp;SER_FROM_HIDDEN=TRue)&#34;&gt;https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/627300000002103b47b?secondshare=weixin&amp;amp;SER_FROM_HIDDEN=TRue)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-5-摩托车溯溪&#34;&gt;Day 5 摩托车&amp;amp;溯溪&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sleeping, physical strength recovered. In the morning, we gathered in the old house of Betty and set off to the valley of the stream. The distance is relatively long, Devin rides motorcycle Betty, I ride a motorcycle to carry another little partner. This is the first time I ride a motorcycle and the first manned, but it is easy to learn. Motorcycles are more stable than battery cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sunny weather, ride county roads, rural trails, and around the mountains, passing by a waterfall, gradually hearing the sound of spring water and seeing clear streams. Put on a sandals, step on the stream, cool and not ice, wading all the way to stepping on the stone, to a pond water. Betty frowned and said that someone had been here. It was destroyed here. There was a car print on the road. The logging camp was built ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped at the side of the pond, fry the raw fire rack, Betty frying the heart of poached eggs, sprinkled the existing black pepper and salt, sandwiched in a bread piece, bite it with a bite, and the egg yolk flowed out. It was very delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devin was healthy, cleaned up the camp, and pulled a suspender before stones and trees. After eating and drinking, I was lying on the hammock, looking at the woods and sky on the top of the mountain in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packing the garbage and luggage, the original road returned, the sun gradually softened, the sun on the valley shown the intimate back of Betty and Devin. What a wonderful afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-6-全家州徒步&#34;&gt;Day 6 全家州徒步&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;按照《孤独星球》桂林篇的指点，我和小伙伴今天计划从兴坪一路徒步到全家州（14 公里）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a passenger car from Yangshuo Bus Station to Xingping, walk along the Lijiang River from Xingping Ancient Town to the Cold Water Village Ferry, take a boat by 10 yuan to cross the river, cross the river is the Bama Painting Mountain, and then continue to walk along the rural highway to the Jiatianxia Scenic Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is not very good. The maximum temperature of the day reached 31 degrees, and there were fewer trees along the road. They were all flat and hot roads. But on the section of the world, it began to become a slate road along the river, with shade and cool breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, a thing that cleaned my soul happened here. There are scattered vendors in the Scenic Area of the A World, and some are older grandparents. According to my consistent habits, I ignore the vendors along the way and not talk to them. My little friend bought two small fish stones at an old grandma. The old grandmother did not have a QR code, but fortunately I brought cash, and my grandmother hesitated to find my 50 yuan banknotes into change, from her volume of change. I found a brand new banknote and replaced me, and the pocket reminded me of my grandmother. I didn&amp;rsquo;t respond yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we met a grandfather again. The friends were there to pick the slingshot there. The grandfather&amp;rsquo;s ears were not listened to our bargaining, but we were more than ten yuan, and then picked up small stones on the ground. far away. Suddenly I was moved. The two shops bought by my friends were the crafts stalls of grandparents and grandma, and I just bought a bag of oranges for thirst. Looking at the grandfather&amp;rsquo;s demonstration, I turned my back and my eyes were wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came back in bed at night, I remembered the grandmother and grandpa I met today. Imagine a long afternoon. They stayed in front of the stall and stayed in the empty old house. Why, I just hope that I can be a kind person in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the slate road, there are no other tourists, there are only us on the road, there are many leaves. The roadside is constantly seeing the warning sign of the &amp;ldquo;collapse section, passing cautious&amp;rdquo;, and also the advertisement of &amp;ldquo;the family weekly hiking section, please call XXX&amp;rdquo;. The experience of this way is very good, passing through the whole family state villages and arriving at the home of the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lonely Planet&amp;rdquo; said that the ferry ship on the other side had been stopped, so we trimmed it at the ferry and washed our feet. I did not intend to see the crossing the river on the crossbar of the ferry. After the call, someone came to drive us to cross the river, 10 yuan per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing the river, it is the orchard. It is not in the direction of Xingping. When the river was resting at the fruit farmers, their large oranges had been picked up and were acquired. They left the fruit and they were preparing to throw away. When we met us, we gave us a large bag of fresh and sweet oranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to move forward is a comfortable trek -butt road hiking route. The villagers said that there were many people who had hiraged here in previous years, and there were few people this year. At Yangti Watshukou, crossing the river, it was already more than 5 pm, and the elementary school was out of school. We waited for the passenger cars with elementary school students at 6:10. Elementary students got out of the car along the way. The windows were blowing in the cool mountain breeze, and the smoke floated in the countryside, and the sun was gentle. Yangti&amp;rsquo;s bus can reach Yangshuo Bus Station, get off at the station, and ride his own electric car back to the homestay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 1st, Yangshuo, two days before the rainy days cold, 13 to 23 degrees, wearing thick jackets and trousers. Later Tianqing became hot immediately, and it was 30 degrees. It is recommended to prepare long -sleeved pants, sunscreen coats, umbrellas, and non -slip sandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to eat with the owner of the inn. At other times, it is 15 bowl of Guilin rice noodles. The authentic rice noodles here do not have soup, it is mixed with powder, adding some sour beans and sour radish, it is delicious. There are three kinds of meat for signature rice noodles, the most expensive, usually 15-20 yuan; I often eat pot-roasted rice noodles, 10-15 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 7 nights in Yangshuo, the three homestays of the three Ai Piguet welcomed the accommodation, but they still recommended that the homestay owner loved to play, and would organize a lot of interesting activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near Yangshuo County, a electric car will be very convenient. Whether you go to Baisha Town to rush the collection or play in the old county and villages, it is not a matter of 20 kilometers back and forth. It is estimated that the mileage can reach up to 40 kilometers and the speed can reach 45 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are passengers at Yangshuo Bus Station to Xingping Town and Yangti Township. The price is within 20 yuan, and there are many times. Not far from the bus station, there are Yangshuo Fengming Tourism Distribution Center. The high -speed rail dedicated line can reach Yangshuo Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yangshuo County People&amp;rsquo;s Hospital can be tested at nucleic acids, and Baisha Town Health Center can also be one of 8 yuan per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you experience the bamboo raft, you must choose the Dragon River section and pay attention to the wet shoes. On the Lijiang River, there is a motor electric plastic raft, and the sound is noisy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The year of not going to work</title>
      <link>https://haroldgao.com/post/gapyear/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>xiangaoole@gmail.com (Harold Gao)</author>
      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/gapyear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early July 2020, he got the company&amp;rsquo;s departure certificate. He left the company&amp;rsquo;s building with a small yellow car under the sun in July. There were very few people on the road. The roads were hot and sunny. In late June 2021, a new work unit is about to enter the job, just a heavy rain, at this time the weather is cool. One year passed, and the days of not going to work will end, and a simple review is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-1-childhood-and-game-console-&#34;&gt;** 1. Childhood and game console **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the three months of the beginning, I realized my dream when I was a child. I bought the Xbox Scorpio game console, a 4K display, and played in a small room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t go back, the immersion of the game in childhood can&amp;rsquo;t go back. My favorite age is between the third grade and the first year of high school. Being able to mention interest, even when I arrived at the university, I just played with my roommate several times &amp;ldquo;The Road to Survival 2&amp;rdquo;. I can&amp;rsquo;t accept the big time in the game. I feel boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the game is very good, the story is great (&amp;ldquo;Witcher 3&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Wild Dart 2&amp;rdquo;), but I can&amp;rsquo;t immerse themselves. After confirming this, I sold these game devices again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to playing games, I also discovered some outdoor groups in Shenzhen, crossed the beaches and hiking mountains, and was deeply convinced by the sea view of South Australia. This is the sea I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-2-living-&#34;&gt;** 2. Living? **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original intention of travel was to go to bed with a bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, my bed was sleeping back and back pain, and I kept it together. I finally felt that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t, but I was not sure whether it was my waist, or the reason for the bed, so I needed to change a bed for a comparison. hotel? Then travel. Check the tickets and accommodation, because there are discounts about the epidemic, then live. The plan to live in Chengdu and Dali has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;三成都&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;三、成都&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a medium -sized luggage and a programmer backpack, in early November, departing from Shenzhen and transferred to Chengdu via Guangzhou. There was a aunt who worked in Shenzhen, who worked in Shenzhen, and taught me some of the tones of Sichuan. The pronunciation of the &amp;ldquo;forty&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;fourteen&amp;rdquo; were really stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du Fu Caotang, People&amp;rsquo;s Park, Kuanzhai Alley, Wuhou Temple, Jinli, this is not the way I want, walking the horse. I simply no longer go to the card, just go to the place I really want to go. That&amp;rsquo;s Qingcheng Mountain hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Qingcheng Mountain twice. The first time I went to Qianshan. The front mountain was mostly Taoist, and there were relatively many tourists. The second time was Houshan, and the tourists were rarely stunned. The small waterfalls are walking in the mountain stream, and the mountain walls with moss are full of moss, and the green spring water is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rest of the day, I just read the book quietly and borrowed &amp;ldquo;Little Fire&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Silent Confession&amp;rdquo; from the library of Chengdu. The homestay that lives is very quiet. Located on the first floor of the old district, a set of residential houses was transformed into three independent homestays. On the ground floor, unfortunately Shu Di was sunny. There are often screams outside the window. There are birds in the morning and the sound of sweeping the floor. Reading in such a house, I feel particularly peaceful, but I just read it for a long time, so my roommate named Shenzhen mail the cold clothes I brought back from the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I would walk to the &amp;ldquo;Huanhua Creek Park&amp;rdquo; south of Dufu Cottage. Watching the cranes in the pond, playing, flying, watching the sky slowly, imagining that I was in the deep valley of no one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half a month, people who didn&amp;rsquo;t speak were quite lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-four-dali-&#34;&gt;** Four, Dali **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid -November, he left Chengdu and reached the long -awaited Dali. After two months of unforgettable two months, it is more interesting and beautiful than I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of a inn, it was difficult to integrate from the beginning, to the familiar place, and the familiar person. The details have been written in the previous diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special of the Dali community I observed is that the crowd here is very diverse, mainly in middle -aged people. The age of 40 is a very full age. Different people gather together. Just listening to them or her sharing, you can feel very rich things. And unlike the sharing of sitting, there are many creators, brewing, bread, organizational activities, writing public accounts, writing novels, climbing, hiking, and building a house. For example, he can build his own shop by himself, cut wood, nails, and work with the workers&amp;rsquo; masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some small shops in Dali also give people a different feeling. The shop is the boss himself. He is not only the boss, but also a member of this community. You can communicate. While he provides you at the same time, he is also a person who is equal to you. In standardized and customer -first chain stores, sometimes people forget this and treat services as machines. How can they relax here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** The development of industrialization has cultivated a lot of specialized people and improved the efficiency of social production, but I actually feel missing. During the day of work, clicking takeaway, taxi, online shopping, a mobile phone can include many scenes of life to others, but therefore feels like becoming a working machine, and all needs can become a product. I want a more delicate life experience, I want to feel my life. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact, I am anxious in Dali. When someone asked me what I did, I just said &amp;ldquo;a programmer&amp;rdquo; and felt very guilty. I haven&amp;rsquo;t created anything for this world, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t proved my ability. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-5-back-to-shenzhen-&#34;&gt;** 5. Back to Shenzhen **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning to Shenzhen, this anxiety quickly dissipated. Back to the familiar scene again, I know that I will go to work soon, and the rest is what to do in the future. The programming world is very large and there are many directions. After trying a few directions, I decided to go back to the direction of my beginning and make this direction well. The rest is to find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** I saw some new things. I found that like Dali&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Dali good&amp;rdquo; public account, Shenzhen also has some public accounts to share local activities. Later, I went to the &amp;ldquo;Psychiatric Declaration&amp;rdquo; bookstore, went to the fans, and met friends who could watch movies and chat together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, when I saw a picture of cooking a good friend who met Dali, I suddenly wanted to cook, and I had to live well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been resistant to the kitchen, and I feel that it is greasy and dirty, and I have hardly cooked since I was small. But suddenly, it started, everything was so natural, do it for yourself, do whatever you want. Peanut oil, raw soy sauce, old soy sauce, oyster sauce, cooking wine, sesame oil, vinegar, ginger, green onion, garlic, green pepper, dried peppers, corn starch, pepper powder, pepper powder, rape vegetables, lettuce, mushrooms, carrots, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish, white radish I am getting familiar with them in my hands. In the past, the reason for blocking me into the kitchen disappeared suddenly, and cooking became a natural thing. And it is very tolerant. It allows me to make some mistakes. It can always be eaten, and it is quite fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is worse? It is the issue of money. I also have a resistance to making money. The &amp;ldquo;Chen Zhiwu Financial Course&amp;rdquo;, which had been bought a long time ago, has gradually picked up, letting &amp;ldquo;direct financing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;indirect financing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bond&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;equity&amp;rdquo; and so on. Life. Money is a subject that runs through modern people&amp;rsquo;s life. It is very regrettable that we do not know or even resist it because of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, maybe the time was a bit mature, and I suddenly wanted to pick up the habit of meditation. A few years ago, I started to contact meditation intermittently, and I also knew that it had a lot of benefits, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. After repeatedly hearing the guests in Jade Podcast mention meditation, I determined to start, so I started the habit of morning meditation. I think that during the time of finding a job, in the adjustment of mentality, it may also benefit from the habit of meditation. I can reduce some resistance and face emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, I voted for my resume, found my favorite job, returned to my professional direction, hoping to do some useful creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost a whole year, is it &amp;ldquo;Gap Year&amp;rdquo;? When I chose to start this year, I did not expect that it would develop this way, but many life topics I wanted to solve at that time were answered to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, quoting &amp;ldquo;Thirteen Invitations&amp;rdquo; S1E9 Xu Zhiyuan conversed Yu Feihong&amp;rsquo;s only words and made a knot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yu: Although it may not have a good impact on young people, in fact, life is meaningless.
Xu: I like a tradition in the West. They believe that life is originally a Permanet Struggle. An eternal struggle will always be calm. Therefore, they must be entangled for a lifetime, and they are practical creativity to face death to overcome this meaninglessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Let&#39;s start with &#34;The Wedding Banquet&#34;</title>
      <link>https://haroldgao.com/post/banquet/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>xiangaoole@gmail.com (Harold Gao)</author>
      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/banquet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At [HTTPS://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cxdsqgbl7qn1MTFAZOJHBG), I watched Li An&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Happy Banquet&amp;rdquo; (released in 1993). This is the second time I look at it. When I look at it, I just feel good -looking, interesting, rich. After reading it, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to say, but in the later Yu Yun, some personal feelings were raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-sexual-depression&#34;&gt;1. Sexual depression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is about sexual descriptions. In the film, the heroine always does not wear bras when painting, and let the thin shirt stick to the chest. This is a true and bold description. In the current film and television works of the mainland, those characters that deliberately expose the cleavage are far less natural. In the back of the film, there is a shot of naked upper upper body when the heroine takes a bath. This lens is unnecessary to promote the plot, but I think it is interacting with the audience, let the audience really participate, and experience &amp;ldquo;five thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand The influence of years of depression on us. When I see this shot, I will suddenly play, and I will observe whether others are seeing me at concentrating on this lens, and I will feel a little bit as embarrassing to express my interest in sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The director only made a shot in the film, and only said one sentence, that is, when the crowd was fried at the wedding banquet, he said to foreign guests, &amp;ldquo;You are seeing the result of 5,000 years of depression.&amp;rdquo; In fact, I did n’t understand at first, why did I add the customs of the wedding and “sex depression” and the cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese are the image of &amp;ldquo;softness and silence and mathematics genius&amp;rdquo; in the eyes of foreigners, but when they arrive at the wedding banquet, they have a lively energy of doing things. The father in the film is the image of a traditional Chinese elder. He likes calligraphy. When he is sitting in the chief, the landlord will have to wash the dishes by himself and give a look at the juniors. But at the wedding banquet, he was very happy when everyone was engaged in all kinds of sexual hints, because the more lively the wedding was, he would be more face. The various signs of the movie also implied that his father was likely to be homosexual, but he was hidden well as a master of the army, as a master of a family, and a traditional Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-perfect-ending&#34;&gt;2. Perfect ending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the film seems to have reached a perfect ending. The same -sex lover has not separated. The heroine gets American green cards and life security. Old parents see their son become a family. But think carefully, how fragile this is perfect. At the beginning of the whole story, the old parents hope that the son can continue the incense of the Gao family, urge his son to get married, and want to hug his grandson early; the old father saw the first sentence of the female lead as &amp;ldquo;can be born and can raise&amp;rdquo;; The Lord&amp;rsquo;s message is, &amp;ldquo;Gao family will thank you.&amp;rdquo; From the perspective of the parents, the mission of traditional culture to them is to continue the family incense. The female lead seems to be a completeness that meets their purpose, but if the girl is born, the expectation of this continuation of the incense is right. It was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the old tradition of continuing the incense (male male) is not eliminated, and not with this tradition, the son in the film will not have a perfect ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-the-present-past-and-future&#34;&gt;3. The present, past, and future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The times are developing. Thirty years ago in the mainland, there may be many Chinese people who were trapped by this old tradition, but in 2021, we clearly have different awareness of LGBT people and girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The director made such a film, and I think it was also recording the Chinese society he observed at the time. One hundred years later, when people see this film, they may be surprised that our culture used to have such a part of this, and it lasted for thousands of years. It may be like we see ancient women&amp;rsquo;s feet now, it is a bad habit that stopped 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we hope that our culture can develop in a better direction, so we have to think about, why can we find and change some bad habits now? Why did we lose their feet 100 years ago, and why do we accept LGBT today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background of &amp;ldquo;Happy Banquet&amp;rdquo; is that Chinese live in the United States. The cultural differences between the younger generations and the older generation of Taiwanese people who live in the United States for a long time have been built. Calling and affecting our footsteps is the return of overseas to study abroad and Chinese people who have accepted new ideas in China. Let us accept LGBT more, I think it is from the frequent attention of mainstream overseas film and television dramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantly exposure to new and different things can increase our awareness of existing things. We need to embrace a variety of opposition, embrace changes against stubbornness, and allow our culture to develop in a better direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is better, which is beyond the times and politics, with the general value of human beings. The universal value of human beings has always existed. For example, in the Dream of Red Mansions, the Qing Dynasty people&amp;rsquo;s attention to the enlightenment of sexual enlightenment, female, and gay men in the Qing Dynasty. These universal values are not only available now, but they are suppressed in the mainstream discourse for a while. Perhaps as the director spoke personally, &amp;ldquo;you are seeing the result of five thousand years of depression.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-remarks&#34;&gt;Reference Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LGBT 是 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender 的缩写，指的是同性恋、双性恋和跨性别者&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Dali to Shenzhen</title>
      <link>https://haroldgao.com/post/shenzhen/</link>

      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/shenzhen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon of 2 months ago, before the plane arrived at Dali Airport, he looked out from a small window. It was a mountain and blue sky, and it was a Dali dam built around Erhai Lake. In the evening when I returned to Shenzhen, I looked out of the small window of the plane. It was the real seawater nearly in front of me, and it was the human lighting of the star on the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am not used to Shenzhen, record my little feelings in the conversion of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advertise&#34;&gt;advertise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive in Shenzhen, walking all the way through the airport channel, subway passage, bus platform, elevator side wall, there are advertising posters everywhere, and advertising movies are also reflected on the electronic display of the eyes. Wrap. One of my roommates is engaged in advertising and copywriting. In the late night, working overtime and meeting in the bedroom. He was also wrapped forward, and then continued to help this push for this push, apply marketing theory, grasp user needs, complete work, and improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future of the British drama &amp;ldquo;Black Mirror&amp;rdquo;, the advertising time of people&amp;rsquo;s views becomes a currency of consumption. The poor must browse the advertisement on the wall display of the room to survive. Once they close their eyes, they will receive the bill warning ⚠️, only there is only there are only, only there is, only there is, only there is, only there is, only there is, only there is, only there is, only there is, only there is, only there is. Spend money to skip the advertisement. The story is exaggerated, but isn&amp;rsquo;t we in a similar environment now? Some APPs start &amp;ldquo;Skip Advertising (3S)&amp;rdquo;, and some non -member 60S advertisements before playback, so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I really need so much, what is my real appeal? Why do I want to watch this TV series and why do I want to eat that food? Is my needs really from me or advertisement around me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;小房间&#34;&gt;小房间&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the room for many days, I suddenly realized its narrow cramped, and the space of 10 square meters was crowded with my daily necessities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the student dormitory to the rental house after work, I finally had their own small rooms. Set up comfortable bedding here, add wardrobe, desk, chair, curtains, racks, storage boxes, green plants, mirrors, coasters, aromatherapy, carefully arrange your own rental house, try to treat it as a home, one After work, a warm nest, a large city belongs to its own windport. I never thought that I was trapped in my room without knowing it, lost the connection with the community and strangers, and closed my heart in a 10 -square -meter space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the exchanges with the Dali community, I maintain the silence of habit. I cannot interact with improvisation and interact with dance partners. Influence. Until gradually, I forgot myself to suppress myself, but just asked because of curiosity, because I wanted to understand, and I started to believe in some natural sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of living, we lived with a suitcase and two backpacks to live in different inn. Gradually used to the large space of the inn, accustomed to not exceeding the three -story residential houses, the blue sky and white clouds, Cangshan Erhai Lake, and Bamboo Tao Birds were used to the roar. Those windy nights, flying sand and stones, the air was hissing, and humans were so humble in the face of this natural power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just travelers of life. Are we really going to be trapped by something? Everything is like a dream, such as dew and electricity, you should watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;城市声音&#34;&gt;城市声音&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place I live in is not in the village in the city, but it is not a quiet community, but an ordinary residential building on the side of the road. On the night of the day I came back, I found that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get quiet. The flute of the big cart in the air, the sound of traffic, and engine vibration (there was an electric diamond sound decorated with a neighbor). Only at midnight and closed the window to get a closed tranquility in the small room. But this is a kind of tranquility without flowing, just like the stagnation behind the tight headphones, which is different from the tranquility that Dali can feel in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-you-lost&#34;&gt;What are you lost?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday evening with my colleagues for dinner, go back after meals, and at the fork intersection, I said, &amp;ldquo;I am very idle anyway, take a walk after meals and accompany you to your house.&amp;rdquo; So he took me to the fruit shops and snacks he often went to, and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I learned about his life scenes. During the year of work, everyone seemed to have their own business, and they were more willing to return to their own small world. We said goodbye to the subway station late at night after get off work, and they went lonely to our small room. I did not know more about the feelings of another soul, and only paid attention to my own one -acre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to busy, the dense population is also intensifying my indifference. In cities where people are surging, people are like air. They need to be accustomed to it and become the background of life. I have to focus on my destination, thoughts, and mobile phone messages, and gradually passivated the perception of human beings around and became more silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning, I dispose of myself on the second -hand platform. There is a folding bed for lunch breaks in the company. The buyer is a bit far away. The courier is expensive and difficult to transport. I simply became a courier and sent it by the subway. After sending the folding bed, I was surprised to find that there was a vegetarian buffet restaurant nearby. I heard that the boss used the title of &amp;ldquo;Brother&amp;rdquo; in the conversation, and felt kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we always pursue high efficiency and optimal solution? In this high -efficiency era, is it really more complacent than in the past? Where did the time to save? What we are pursuing, what we have lost is really worth it? &amp;ldquo;Cafe at the End of the World&amp;rdquo; raised three questions, &amp;ldquo;Why are you coming to this world?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Are you afraid of death?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Are you satisfied?&amp;rdquo;, What is your answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenzhen is a colorful scroll, but it is painted with a lot of painting. The space that can be left in white is filled with advertisements, buildings, sounds and crowds. How powerful, firm and wisdom do we need to filter out those extra things and return to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is all the contents of this article. If you have any opinions and suggestions, please leave me a message in the comment area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The story of &amp;ldquo;Black Mirror&amp;rdquo; mentioned in the text comes from the second episode of the first season &amp;ldquo;The value of 15 million&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://movie.douban.com/subject/7054120/&#34;&gt;https://movie.douban.com/subject/7054120/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>A guide to living in Dali</title>
      <link>https://haroldgao.com/post/dali/</link>

      <guid>https://haroldgao.com/post/dali/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cangshan Erhai Lake is beautiful, but the place where Dali is most attractive is actually its precious community atmosphere. If you want to understand what this community atmosphere is in advance, you may wish to read the book &amp;ldquo;Dali Interview: as if there is a light&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My longing for Dali was influenced by [Jade&amp;rsquo;s Podcast &amp;ldquo;Evening Wind&amp;rdquo;] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e50jade-60754923)&#34;&gt;https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e50jade-60754923)&lt;/a&gt;. In early 2020, the epidemic was finally promoted to travel from Beijing to Dali, and started a series of podcast programs interviewed by Dali Life. In those days, I struggled in Shenzhen, and often listened to these podcasts in the evening of the weekend, running along the seaside, and at those gentle nights, the other life choices presented in the show gradually moved me. In the end, at the end of 2020, I also came to Dali and lived for 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a travel notes, nor will it cover many Dali Internet celebrity punch points. It is a fragment that I like very much in slow travel. It constitutes Dali I yearn for. In two months, in addition to 3 days in Shaxi Ancient Town and Jianchuan Ancient Town in Jianchuan County, I went to Jizi Mountain in Binchuan County to climb the mountain in one day. Surrounding activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一部分介绍大理吸引我的地方和人，第二部分分享我收集的旅行信息。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part1有趣的地方和人&#34;&gt;Part1：有趣的地方和人&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came to the ancient city of Dali, I visited the writer Chen Xiaochen on Douban on the bell floor of the bell on Guangwu Road. He listened to the digital tourist on Douban Yeye&amp;rsquo;s on -site lecture on 706 Dali, and the player of the player &amp;ldquo;The Wind Wind&amp;rdquo;. Dali in September, I encountered Roy and SUE, who was passing by the B station when I ate in my dinner, was a large -scale star chase scene. Not to mention other interesting people you meet. Dali is a place where a person is very close to people. I participated in several activities and entered a few WeChat groups. I ate a few more meals in the same restaurant. Before you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dali is a place of slow life. There is a story that may be a bit extremely extreme. A friend ordered a large plate of chicken in a restaurant. The boss was eating, so he let me wait for more than 20 minutes. There is a well -known burger shop in the ancient town of Shaxi. The boss only makes about 20 beef burgers every day. The guests who come late can only eat other ones, or make an appointment for the next day. I came here for two meals. I did n’t eat beef burgers when I arrived at the meal. I was eaten the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come to Dali and want to get to know some friends who may be able to talk quickly, then you can participate in some activities. &amp;ldquo;[Dali is good at] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7W727q2_oxguf27gart4oa)%22&#34;&gt;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7W727q2_oxguf27gart4oa)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; This public account summarized many recent activities near Dali ancient city, and we must pay attention. Below I also introduce some of the interesting places I have encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;本素拾堂&#34;&gt;本素拾堂&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*(The return visit in September 2022, the master opened the passenger, and the cafeteria turned to a pair of mother and daughter who believed in Buddhism. She would play the chanting sound when eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a vegetarian restaurant, located next to Yiduo Cafe in Mujimou. The boss is called &amp;ldquo;Brother&amp;rdquo; and an old Douban user and northeast. My half of my food is here, this is the &amp;ldquo;late night cafeteria&amp;rdquo; in my heart. Tourists who come to dinner often can&amp;rsquo;t find who the boss is, and other diners will guide where to scan the code, and take a few meal boxes, where is the paper cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elder brother often lay on a lounge chair at the door, wearing a pair of glasses, reading a book in the sun, and having a cooked customer. I can often encounter some familiar faces and sounds when eating, and they are often familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I especially like the oil poem written on the small blackboard in front of the restaurant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small shop, two beings. &lt;br/&gt;
Three meals are vegetarian, cycle of four seasons. &lt;br/&gt;
In the end of Old Cangshan, sprinkle Bone Erhai Lake. &lt;br/&gt;
生死放下，聚散由之。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-42&#34;&gt;Space 42&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(In 2021, Sister Lu came to Wutongshan, Shenzhen, and started online. In 2022, the Feidenquis course teacher Dora went round and forth in Shenzhen and Dali. .)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public account &amp;ldquo;[space 42] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/njgen5o76bugg3tjaewa)%22&#34;&gt;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/njgen5o76bugg3tjaewa)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Space 42 is located in the third phase of the landscape community near Dali University outside the ancient city. It takes half an hour to ride a small battery for each time. In this way, I often come to participate in the event. For the first time, I have been exposed to improvisation, free chanting, Ukraine, and Ferdenquis aware of the course. This is a world full of spirituality and tenderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the language stops, feel when it feels. When we pay attention to the awareness of the body and the vibration of the sound, everything begins to be different. Here is a special feeling to give me a special feeling. When the guide lets us do a movement, I feel that I have been allowed to do bad, allowed to cooperate, allowed to fall asleep. Instead, I can play as much as possible to try those who are not used to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first time I came here to participate in the event, the hostess Lu gave me a hug to be flattered; at the end of the last time I participated in the event, Lu learned that I was leaving Dali, and gave me a hug again. Essence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;706-dali-living-laboratory&#34;&gt;706 (Dali) Living Laboratory&lt;/h3&gt;

It is located in a small yard on Yincang Road. It is interesting to rent and lease to the 706 community specifications and organize sharing and lectures. At that time, a group of interesting young people were gathered here, including digital tourist Yeye (public account and podcast &amp;ldquo;[not working commune] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fw4c1qro2ckafkmqqqqqnbb7w)%22)&#34;&gt;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fw4c1qro2ckafkmqqqqqnbb7w)&amp;quot;)&lt;/a&gt;, and Danniel (public account &amp;ldquo;[Digital Woman Intelligence Bureau] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s/sfoewac1-gg1-ryn6pcixa))&#34;&gt;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s/sfoewac1-gg1-ryn6pcixa))&lt;/a&gt;, as well The kind of excitement when he was childhood), former Google programmer Ren (he said, &amp;ldquo;To the extreme of what you like, the opportunity will come to you&amp;rdquo;) and so on.

If you like to read, don&amp;rsquo;t miss this. The book of the science comes from donations, and the quality is very high. I read &amp;ldquo;You Be a Bird Flying to Your Mountain&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Buried Giants&amp;rdquo;. The tables and chairs and atmospheres here are very close to the library, suitable for reading and office quietly (that is, a bit cold in winter). The physics is also a inn.

If you like music, such as Winter Bulu, Jazz, Bruce or some pioneers, come here to try it. This is a long bar in the ancient city. It is famous in the long -resident group. It is located in a small yard that is difficult for tourists to find. Essence The wine in the bar is cheap, and a cup of gold soup is 35 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance usually starts at 8:30 in the evening on Friday and weekends. Some are free and some charges. The musicians in the wooden house were crowded together forgotten, and the audience squeezed on the grass pads to listen relaxing. Someone in the yard was baking fire. Someone was talking. The night was gentle and the stars flickered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a factory area south of the ancient city of Dali. Because it is separated by a military management zone in the middle of it, it is at the end of a small road. It is also rare for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite in the factory area is the climbing wall transformed from the corridor. The single climbing is only 30 yuan. It is open every May and 6th in the afternoon. Looking at the rock climbing here, I feel happy and happy. envious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place I like is the more famous dolphin Ade Shop (public account &amp;ldquo;[Dolphin Ade Shop] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qyshjxnrh7dqbfxyw4y5qqq)%22)&#34;&gt;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qyshjxnrh7dqbfxyw4y5qqq)&amp;quot;)&lt;/a&gt;, half of the book area, half of the book area, half of the book area In the coffee area, some cultural and creative works are also sold in the book area. The book area is not allowed to bring the book area to the coffee area, but there is a small bookshelf in the coffee area for free. If you buy a cup of coffee, it is very comfortable to sit here for an afternoon. In the bookstore, there is a book &amp;ldquo;Under Cangshan&amp;rdquo; that I can&amp;rsquo;t buy online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real society, &amp;ldquo;mainstream values&amp;rdquo; are devoured us every second, turning us into various &amp;ldquo;categories&amp;rdquo;. What is even more terrible is that after we really enter the category of &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;, happiness has not come, and boring and emptiness will come one after another. Because from the beginning of our extremely utilitarian education, to continuous &amp;ldquo;struggle&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; after entering the society, there is no time to find time and space for interest. As a result, the most boring and pale well -off generation in this country has appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-seasons-market-store-second-floor&#34;&gt;（(Four Seasons Market Store) Second Floor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The return visit in September 2022, it has been closed, the four seasons market is deserted, and the toilet is sealed.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first arrived in Dali in November, the Elk Market was still barren. It has been repaired before New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day. There are slides, grasslands, and exquisite small shops. There are often bonfires at night, which is worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabing&amp;rsquo;s hut (Four Seasons Market Store) is in the elk market. The first floor is a bar, and the second floor is a 24 -hour free open library. The light on the second floor is particularly good, and it will be exposed to the sun in the afternoon like an oven. There are many books and miscellaneous books. There are many types of literary names of various literatures. There are many categories of novels. There are long tables to work, and there are sofas to lie down. It is suitable for bookworms to read here. The old book pile in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;适合办公学习的地方&#34;&gt;适合办公学习的地方&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that friends who live in long -lived may have the needs of office learning, here is a summary of some choices that can be tried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In the Temple of the Temple, from the perspective of the friends circle of the young partner, it is what the normal library looks like. free.
-Chologics: very suitable for reading office. The only disadvantage is that it is a bit cold in winter. You can not consume, or order a cup of tea (10 yuan) with an unlimited renewal.

Professional, and convenient to know some friends with long -range or freelance. The location is near March Street, and the ancient city road is needed to cross the West View Line. The rental rent seems to be 600 yuan per month.
-The second floor of Dabing&amp;rsquo;s hut (Siji Market Store): The old book pile in the attic, there are desks and chairs. free.
-Weong Tong Academy: Located in the small alley next to the bustling Renmin Road, there are not many high -quality books, but there are not many high -quality books, but the space is very large and the tables and chairs are comfortable. You can take a seat for free, but you don&amp;rsquo;t buy a cup of coffee a little embarrassed (from 30 yuan).
-D dolphin Ade Coffee Area: The environment is very good, the background jazz, but the coffee table is not high, you may need to put your laptop on your legs. But the atmosphere of the coffee area makes the office efficiency high. From 35 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2大理旅居信息&#34;&gt;Part 2：大理旅居信息&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are already excited and want to come to Dali life for a while, then the following is some of the living information I collected, I hope it will be helpful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient city of Dali faced Erhai Lake, Cangshan in the west, went to the south, and went north to Xizhou. There are 4 gates in east and west, north and south are Erhai Gate, Cangshan Gate, South Gate and North Gate. It is easy to distinguish the orientation in the ancient city, and look up &amp;ldquo;seeing Cangshan leisurely&amp;rdquo;, which is the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;气候&#34;&gt;气候&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to Dali in winter (November to January), and I also experienced the coldest days in Dali since 2016. The biggest feature of Dali&amp;rsquo;s climate is that the temperature difference is large and the ultraviolet strength is high. Here you will strongly feel that &amp;ldquo;the growth of all things depends on the sun&amp;rdquo;. Most of the time is a blue sky. There will be a large white cloud on the top of Cangshan. The temperature of the day is 20-4 degrees Celsius, which is mainly determined by whether the sunlight is sufficient. Because the sunlight ultraviolet rays are very strong, students who mind black must pay attention to sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking or dazing under the sun, I will wear a warm underwear and a sports sweater; the clouds cover, it will soon be cold, and add a shake pill coat. Most of the time, there is no need for down jackets, but it is necessary to bring one piece. The coldest time is enough, and it is also used to board Cangshan. On January 11th and 12th, 2021, the coldest days I met. The temperature was about 5- -1 degrees Celsius. The snow seeds were in the ancient city. I wore a low down jacket and a scarf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-a-meal&#34;&gt;Have a meal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating alone, my choice is mainly rice noodles, vegetarian self -service, and small fried rice. The meal is 10-15 yuan. I went to dinner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Yi Ran Hall: There is a self -service fast rice (5 yuan meals+1 yuan paper bowl) for lunch and dinner. It will play the &amp;ldquo;Amitabha&amp;rdquo; chanting background music. You can eat full, and the taste is relatively simple.
-The place where I get the most, lunch is a vegetarian buffet, 13 yuan per person, with soy milk, black rice porridge, and sometimes I can meet bread slices and egg fried rice. There are eggs, the others are vegan, are northeast, very delicious; dinner is noodles, about 10 yuan, some noodles have green onions, you can add fried eggs.
-The Yunfeng Yao Rice Noodle: Wangzi Braised Pork Rice Noodles, Wangzi is Mao Bloody, the taste is delicious, and the big bowl is only 12 yuan.
-Original Earth Chicken Rice Noodles: Erhai Gate of the Ancient City, Chicken Soup is superb, and a large bowl of native chicken noodles is 15 yuan.
-In the north -south private kitchen: The form is very similar to Japanese materials. The boss will cook under your eyelids and make it in front of you. It looks very high -level but the price is relatively close to the people. The simple package is 28 yuan to 40 yuan. The boss likes to cook and seriously do what he likes.
-The halal snack: It is also very famous. The boss said that &amp;ldquo;color wood&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo;. Qingshu beef rice noodles (beef slices), red -roasted beef rice noodles (a lot of beef pieces), dried fried rice, beef sausage fried rice, chicken intestine fried rice is delicious; there are many old customers who like to eat braised beef beef rice, I will feel a bit salty It&amp;rsquo;s right.
-Suixin Garden Halal Snack: A humble shop, the restaurant is full of locals, and chicken fried rice (12 yuan) is delicious than wood.
-The local fried local fried local fried in the Dali September Bar: Back to the pot, the meat is really fragrant, 14 yuan.
-Afang Street Supermarket (Yu&amp;rsquo;er Store): Packing 10 yuan for two plain and two vegetarian, you can also eat 15 yuan in the store.
-Beimen Cai Market: The lowest price in the ancient city, the fruit is delicious and cheap.
-Sunan Gate Green Yu Farmers Market: Outside the south gate of the ancient city: there are many foods: lemon chicken, Xiao Yang chicken feet, Yang&amp;rsquo;s first volume of powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;长租&#34;&gt;长租&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stay in the inn, the monthly rent is between 800 and 1800. 800 ~ 1200 close to the usual standard room, a large bed of 1.5m, independent bathroom, small tables and small stools, public washing machines, kitchens, top of the building; The table. Of course, these are the prices of tourism off -season, and some inn can increase prices in the peak tourist season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some long -term rental information of Dali can be found in the Douban group &amp;ldquo;Love Dali&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dali Rental House&amp;rdquo;. You can also rent for a few days first, and then inspect the inn in the field after you come. There are many inn in the ancient city of Dali. In addition, there are inn, around the ancient city. Seeing a lot of leases on Douban is still near the south gate and near Erhai Gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;出行&#34;&gt;出行&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you travel in the ancient city of Dali, walk from south to north, from east to west for about 20 minutes. If the activity is frequent, you can rent a small electric vehicle. I rent a Harbin electric vehicle. The monthly rent is 169 yuan. It can ride more than ten kilometers and charge it at the inn. There is no bicycle sharing in the ancient city, and the Huanhai Greenway in Erhai Lake is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient city of Dali went to the country, and most cars started from Xiaguan County, and could be found on Ctrip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dali Ancient City went to Lijiang: There is a direct train to Shimonatsu City. It is said that you can show off the passenger cars on the Dali Line Highway. The window on the car hanging on the car on the car is hung on Lijiang. It will stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dali Ancient City went to the ancient town of Shaxi: Shimonoseki has a shuttle bus to the passenger station of Jianchuan County, once every 20 minutes. I stopped the car on the Dali Line Highway; when I arrived at the Passenger Station of Jianchuan County, there was a green small van on the right side of the passenger station. Two passenger cars are the most saved, with a total of 55 yuan (40+15). If you want to save trouble, you can consult in the Lanling Pavilion Hotel in the ancient city of Dali. There are charters directly to Lanling Pavilion Hotel in Shaxi Ancient Town. It is said that it is more than 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient city of Dali went to Jizao Mountain: Shimonoseki has a shuttle bus to the entrance to the entrance of Jizao Mountain, which can be purchased by Ctrip. However, the time to return the bus was too early. I met the journey at 3 pm. If the mountain is not climbed throughout the process, it is enough to take the ropeway and the sightseeing car. Like I climbed up the mountain, I played for a long time, and I went to the entrance until 6 o&amp;rsquo;clock. In the end, several people chartered the car and returned to Xiaguan City (70 yuan per person), and then took the bus from Xiaguan to the ancient city of Dali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;环洱海&#34;&gt;环洱海&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erhai Lake is not a sea, but it is more beautiful than many sea views. This is due to its mountains, light, and clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clean -seas roads are built along the Erhai Line. On the one hand, there is the Haixi Line, and on the other side, there are the east of the Huanhai. In the middle, there are some sections of the road. The management of the Haixi Line Greenway near the ancient city is very strict. Only the cycling of cycling is allowed to prohibit electric vehicles and other motor vehicles; the Haixi Line green road can also ride an electric car; Most sections are red bicycle lanes, and luxury sports cars are common on roads, large trucks and tourists on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest seaside to the ancient city is the Cai Village Pier, and the south is the more famous Longxi Terminal. Here is very suitable for taking a family picnic on the grass in the afternoon, a large piece of grassland, the brownish yellow woods by the water, the bright sunlight shoots the beam through the clouds, and you can hear the sound of water and birds quietly, as if you are in a fairy tale world. Of course, these three Huanhai Green Road also attracted many tourists to take pictures and punch cards. The Dragon Terminal often hovers from seagulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, the Haidong Line can see the Cangshan Erhai Lake, the sun and the clouds are just right, and the scenery is very good. Shuanglang Ancient Town is a beautiful attraction. In addition to the famous Sun Palace, the architecture here is also very famous, suitable for taking pictures. Both mountains and Hai are great backgrounds, so there are also many newcomers who take wedding photos in Haidong Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Erhai Ring Line is about 128 kilometers. The ride -riding car departs from Erhai Gate to the north. , Digging Pier, Little Putuo Island, Luo Tsui Peninsula, Jintou Island, along the airport to the city, Erhai Park, and finally returned to the city from the south gate. It lasted for 11 and a half hours, departed at 9 am, and returned at 8:30 in the evening. At about 7 pm, it will be dark. After dark, the cycling will be cold, and gloves need to keep gloves warm. I was exhausted to return to the ancient city from Xiaguan City, and I would also have a pain in the ride for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not recommended that most people ride, because physical conditions and food reserves are needed, most sections are actually boring. They must also squeeze and squeeze them with large cars. In the ancient city, there were electric vehicles leased by large electricity, and the price was not cheap, but the ring was fast and relaxed. It could stop at any time when encountering good scenery. It is recommended to use ordinary tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deng-cangshan&#34;&gt;Deng Cangshan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest part of Cangshan is 4,000 meters above sea level, and there are 3 ropeways from south to north. Neutronous ropeways are almost in a straight line as the North City Wall of the Ancient City. Washing the Malitan ropeway and the ancient city South City Wall are in a straight line. After passing through the Tianlong Babu Film and Television City, the sensor is the farthest, usually as the starting station of tourists climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most classic boarding route: Sensing Ropeway-Xima Tan Ropeway Station-Mountain Top-Marta Caudi Way down-Tianlong Babu Film and Television City. &lt;code&gt;Sensing ropeways&lt;/code&gt; to the mountainside, along the lack of the jade belt, to the middle station of the Malang Roperway, take the Malitan ropeway to the top of the mountain, wearing a down jacket at the Cangshan at an altitude of 4000 meters, and then take the horses. Lotteryway to &lt;code&gt;Tianlong Babu Film and Television City&lt;/code&gt;, finally returned to the ancient city. The top of the mountain is nearly 4000 meters, and a down jacket is required. You can also rent it on the mountain. Students with plateau reactions remember to buy a bottle of portable oxygen tanks under the mountain. (When I went to climb Cangshan in late November 2020, because of the landslide of the mountains, the middle station and the lower stop of the Malitan ropeway were closed, and I could not go to the film and television city)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is the Yuzhao Road Yunyou route: Senteng Ropeway-Yugai Road-Zhonghe Temple-Zhonghe Ropeway-March Street. If you are more interested in walking after walking around, you can not take the Malaysian Roper Way to stand up the mountain, but continue to walk along the &lt;code&gt;Yugai Road&amp;quot; to Zhonghe Temple &lt;/code&gt;, sit down the mountain in neutral ropeway. The whole jade belt road is about 11.5 kilometers. Everyone must consider the time, because the last shift of the neutral ropeway is issued at 4:30, and the ropeway is very slow. The path is directly below the ropeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why many people choose to start from the Tongtong Temple ropeway is because the attractions are the most, and there are very few scenic spots in neutralization. The Internet celebrity punch the point &lt;code&gt;Silent Zhao Yue&lt;/code&gt; is at the entrance of the ropeway of the Tongtong Temple. There are many fleshy plants in the silent photos. The whole pattern is small and exquisite. Many tourists will come here at 11:30 noon. Otherwise, it will be punished and washed the dishes. After lunch, start the afternoon climbing journey from the Tongtong Copleway. Taxi can go directly to the silence, and take a large slope of mountain roads to save energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is my first experience in climbing on Cangshan. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the flatness of the jade belt. Mountaineering shoes will be easy to get tired after walking on such a flat road for a long time. The experience of the second climbing mountain was more comfortable. At that time, under the leadership of the familiar partners, we went up the mountain from the road of Santa, all the way to a thick pine needle. When entering the forest, the wind blows Song Tao. We share experiences and fruits, so quiet afternoon. When we went to Yu Bao Road, we walked to Zhonghe Temple, walking down the mountain from Zhonghe Temple, through the gravity and the buffer of the mountaineering stick, down the mountain is extremely fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, walking in Tu Road is more recommended. However, the temperature difference between Cangshan is large, especially the route above the jade belt has certain risks, and it needs to be led by guide. Forest fire prevention responsibilities are important, please do not bring fire to the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shaxi-ancient-town&#34;&gt;Shaxi Ancient Town&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coming to the ancient city of Dali for a month, someone kept telling me that there were two places worth going in Dali, one was the ancient town of Shaxi and the other was Jizao Mountain. Finally, at the right time, I set off. The transportation method from the ancient city of Dali to Shaxi has been introduced in the &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient town of Shaxi in Jianchuan County is a place that is more avoided than the ancient city of Dali. Some people say that it is like the ancient city of Dali a few years ago. There are not many inn in the ancient town. It is concentrated in the northeast area. Other parts are the living places of residents in the town. It is like a small town that I grew up since I was a child. , Crowded with people selling various agricultural and sideline products, but the markets in the ancient town of Shaxi often see foreigners, and Chinese guides explained to them what products they sold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to experience a secluded pastoral life, it is very suitable. The ancient town is full of quaint houses everywhere. The ancient theater is very beautiful and easy to take pictures. The east side of the ancient town has an arched Yujin Bridge. It takes 1 kilometer on the countryside, and it has reached the relatively popular &amp;ldquo;Pioneer Shaxi Bai Tubu&amp;rdquo;, the earth -colored Shaxi red wall, and the tall bookshelf in the bookstore is full. There is a dazzling book, there is a cafe next to it. In a day, you can visit the corner of the ancient town. At night, it is shrouded in the night. Only the lights of the inn are left. You can see the stars in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to go, just basking in the sun on the top of the youth hostel, listening to the crowd of the lambs in the house downstairs, next to the tiles of jelly tiles in the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s house, sending it. Stay for a while. Walking to Yujin Bridge, slowly walking north along the stream, forgetting the time of passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Northeast area, there are also some interesting shops. For example, the beef burger of the &amp;ldquo;西 12 Western Restaurant&amp;rdquo;, station B UP said that the city said that it reminded him of the taste of Australia. Beef Hamburg only does about 20 every day, which is very sought -after and can make an appointment in advance. There is also the youth hostel that I have lived for two nights. The boss and his friends often play darts downstairs. They play very professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;鸡足山&#34;&gt;鸡足山&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jizu Mountain, Binchuan County is one of the top ten famous mountains in Buddhism, and the dojo of Gaye Bodhisattva. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the specific significance. The way of transportation from the ancient city of Dali to Jizushan has been introduced in the &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo; section. Many temples and nuns on the mountain. If you take a sightseeing car and the ropeway to Jinding Temple throughout the process, you will miss a lot of temples on the road, including the Ga Ye Temple. You can take a sightseeing car and ropeway when you go up the mountain, and walk down the mountain, so that you can be physically and good at the attractions, although it may hurt your knees. I climbed into the golden top. I wonder if it was 3,000 meters above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many temples on the mountain can provide accommodation, can also eat fast meals, morning and evening classes. The accommodation conditions seen in the Gaye Temple are a bit similar to the youth hostel. Collective dormitory, single bed, electric blanket, and cheap. There is a lotus table on the side courtyard of the Ga Ye Hall, which looks extraordinarily Zen in the mountains. Just when I went, I saw a monk wearing a yellow cotton jacket and meditating his eyes in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
