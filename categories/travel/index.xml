      <description>&lt;p&gt;At less than 6:30 on Sunday, I woke up from the bed, picked up the mobile phone on the table, checked the matters to be handled today, and waited for the alarm clock at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At less than 7:30, I was already sitting on the bench of the restaurant, carrying a schoolbag, there were scholarship for breakfast, half a bottle of hot boiling water, and a Chinese novel borrowed to me by Taiwan classmates. Finally, Teacher Zelle came in. &amp;ldquo;Wait a while, I drink a cup of coffee.&amp;rdquo; Saying her tearing the coffee powder bag, bent over to push the water coffee in front of the water dispenser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain was crackling outside. Recently, there seems to be a typhoon passing. This week&amp;rsquo;s rain is intermittent. After a while, the slippers under the eaves are poured down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 30, 2023, Shenzhen, China, in the afternoon of Friday, looked back at a small 10 -square -meter room that had lived for 4 years. There are also movie posters bought by Taobao, and the desktop has been cleaned up. Seeing that it resumed the empty appearance, I felt a little panicked. This small room that had lived for 4 years has no longer belonging to me. In this city, country, and even the planet, I will start a section of a certain place where there is no place. The journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon of 2 months ago, before the plane arrived at Dali Airport, he looked out from a small window. It was a mountain and blue sky, and it was a Dali dam built around Erhai Lake. In the evening when I returned to Shenzhen, I looked out of the small window of the plane. It was the real seawater nearly in front of me, and it was the human lighting of the star on the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am not used to Shenzhen, record my little feelings in the conversion of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A guide to living in Dali</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cangshan Erhai Lake is beautiful, but the place where Dali is most attractive is actually its precious community atmosphere. If you want to understand what this community atmosphere is in advance, you may wish to read the book &amp;ldquo;Dali Interview: as if there is a light&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My longing for Dali was influenced by [Jade&amp;rsquo;s Podcast &amp;ldquo;Evening Wind&amp;rdquo;] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e50jade-60754923)&#34;&gt;https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/1054935/episodes/e50jade-60754923)&lt;/a&gt;. In early 2020, the epidemic was finally promoted to travel from Beijing to Dali, and started a series of podcast programs interviewed by Dali Life. In those days, I struggled in Shenzhen, and often listened to these podcasts in the evening of the weekend, running along the seaside, and at those gentle nights, the other life choices presented in the show gradually moved me. In the end, at the end of 2020, I also came to Dali and lived for 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a travel notes, nor will it cover many Dali Internet celebrity punch points. It is a fragment that I like very much in slow travel. It constitutes Dali I yearn for. In two months, in addition to 3 days in Shaxi Ancient Town and Jianchuan Ancient Town in Jianchuan County, I went to Jizi Mountain in Binchuan County to climb the mountain in one day. Surrounding activities.&lt;/p&gt;
