&lt;p&gt;** Editor&amp;rsquo;s click: vivi is my classmate in the character interview class. Seeing her self -introduction, I was attracted to it all at once, and then learned more about her stories about her through Xiaohongshu. Finally, at 11 am in Beijing time, at 8 pm in San Francisco time, crossing half of the earth, we started this online interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 is the fourth year of Vivi working in the United States. Now she is a product designer in Microsoft. Her Cloudai team is connected to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new generation of artificial intelligence products to the project of the cloud service platform Azure. The era of a national AI has come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
