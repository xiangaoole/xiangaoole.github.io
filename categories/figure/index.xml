&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s note&lt;/strong&gt; : Vivi is my classmate in the character interview class. I was immediately attracted to her when I saw her self-introduction, and then learned more about her story through Xiaohongshu. Finally, at 11 a.m. Beijing time and 8 p.m. San Francisco time, halfway around the world, we started this online interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 is Vivi&amp;rsquo;s fourth year working in the United States. She is now working as a product designer at Microsoft. Her CloudAI team is integrating Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new generation artificial intelligence product Copilot into the cloud service platform Azure project. An era of universal AI has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
