Intensive listening to Chinese podcasts over the past few years has had a huge impact on me. I&amp;rsquo;m curious, what inspiration will the world of English podcasts bring me? I have switched most of my daily information input to English. This series serves as a monthly review of English input and recommends some of my favorite podcasts and texts from the previous month.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 27 years old now. I had my first English course around at the age of 10. At that time English was not a course being taught at elementary school, and it usually was taught starting in middle school. But my mother found a teacher to teach me simple English words on Saturdays. I mainly learned basic vocabulary, such as numbers, months and letters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
